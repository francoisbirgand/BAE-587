I suppose we are never done with a subject which is rather amorphous, as it involves many disciplines, and has many fields of application. Wikipedia (2018m) has some nice definitions of Biogeochemistry, including: In particular, biogeochemistry is the study of the cycles of chemical elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, and their interactions with and incorporation into living things transported through earth scale biological systems in space through time. With the definition above, the study of ancient earth history or of modern acid rains (e.g., Degens 1989; Schlesinger 2005) are included in biogeochemistry… The unifying theme is that regardless of the application, the processes involved stay pretty much the same and involve transfer of electrons and protons. Differentiation within biogeochemistry come from the fields of application. The field of application of this book is excess nutrient and sediment loads generated by human activities, their consequences on aquatic ecosystems, and the processes involved to improve and protect groundwater and surface water quality in watersheds. There is a niche in disturbed, nutrient rich, often rural environments, where we perceive there is a need for an integrated and horizontal delivery of knowledge spanning from electron orbitals, biochemistry, cell microbiology, hydrological functioning, process kinetics modeling, and treatment system design. It is possible that readers with strong biological background might find the biological facet of this book a bit short and simple. Just as well, non-engineers should not be afraid of ‘engineering’ in the title. The course is designed to provide the biological knowledge engineers might not have obtained in their curriculae, and the quantitative knowledge non-engineers might not have been exposed to as well. Regardless, I do hope that environmental scientists, ecologists, and engineers alike, will find the integration of knowledge useful in this book. The physical objects used as foundation for this class include naturally occurring and human-designed filters, which may reduce excess nutrient concentrations and loads in rural and suburban environments. Systems reviewed include wetlands, riparian buffers and vegetated filter strips, woodchip bioreactors, streams, stormwater ponds and bioretention zones. This book uses excess nitrogen as the core parameter where the principles of biogeochemical processes are illustrated, and may apply to other fields of application. In summary, this book provides the basic necessary biogeochemical knowledge to answer these questions: How do wetlands, streams, riparian zones, woodchip bioreactors, and other ecologically based treatment systems filter excess nutrient out of the aquatic environment? How can we as a society or as ecological engineers and as environmental scientists use or design treatment systems to filter out excess nutrients? 1.2 Biogeochemical processes in pollution flows This book is intrinsically related to the concept of pollution, the consequences of pollution, and what can be done about it. Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change (Wikipedia contributors 2018p). Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities, leading to degradation of aquatic ecosystems (Wikipedia contributors 2018j) The goals of environmental and ecological engineers and scientists are to reduce pollution, and in our case improve water quality. The concept of water pollution implies that there is a source of contamination, contaminants, and at the end, adverse consequences on aquatic ecosystems, but also on human health. It is interesting to realize that there is almost an infinite number of ‘pathways’ from a pollution source to its consequences. To replace the field of application of the biogeochemical processes described in this book, one can take an example of a pathway from contaminants to consequences to illustrate the knowledge areas this book focuses on. The most spectacular events are usually reported in the press, which has been extremely instrumental in increasing the global awareness at all levels, and in many cases have triggered regulation changes. The most infamous case was when the Cuyahoga River repeatedly catching on fire near Cleveland caught the attention of the Time Magazine in 1969 (Latson 2015), eventually leading to the Clean Water Act in 1972 (Wikipedia contributors 2018o). Newspaper articles relating and explaining the causes and consequences of pollution are remarkable in many ways: they have a way to encapsulate much information, in simple and concise terms. Since most scientists and engineers are pretty good visual learners, a complimentary approach to written articles can be visual objects. Telling the same story in the form of a flow chart translating a two page article in one visual object can be very effective in a class setting. For this, I have created a simple template to derive such ‘pollution flow charts’. A list of symbols illustrating the important steps between the pollution cause(s) to its consequence(s) are proposed in Table 1.1 below. Table 1.1: List of symbols used to construct a pollution flow chart, which can visually describe pollutions from their sources to their consequences Illustrated Symbol shape Symbol shape Description Label shape list of all the Non Point Sources (NPS) and point sources (PS) Rectangle lists all the direct pollutants resulting from the source(s) Diamond vector(s) of the pollutant(s). Often several Rounded rectangle receiving air or water bodies. Often several Disk macroscale consequence(s), often visible Heart lists all the health risks identified Pentagon lists all the identified environmental consequences Equipped with this tool box, it is possible to visually summarize the flow of pollution for most situations. In 2017, an article was written by Lisa W. Foderaro about the causes and consequences of dysfunctional septic tanks in Long Island, NY, USA. It takes the reader between 5 to 10 min to read the article. I let the reader do just that here. ‘Dead Rivers, Closed Beaches’: A Water Crisis on Long Island By LISA W. FODERARO MAY 8, 2017 OAKDALE, N.Y. — The Great South Bay, flanked by Fire Island and the South Shore of Long Island, once produced half the shellfish consumed in the United States, and supported 6,000 jobs in the early 1970s. Since then, the health of the bay has declined. Housing development meant more septic tanks depositing more nitrogen in the ground. The nitrogen flowed to rivers and the Great South Bay, leading to algae blooms. It depleted salt marshes that serve as fish habitat and suppressed oxygen levels. One result is that the shellfish industry has all but collapsed. The annual harvest of hard clams, for example, has fallen more than 90 percent since 1980. After sweeping legislation that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed in April, Suffolk County and other local governments in New York are hoping to deal with their aging — or absent — sewer lines, drinking water systems and other water infrastructure. The law, the Clean Water Infrastructure Act, allocates $2.5 billion to a variety of projects, as concerns about the safety of drinking water are growing. Across the United States, impressive gains in water quality were made in the decades after passage of the Clean Water Act of 1972. But courts have generally ruled that the federal law was designed to address surface water contamination, and are divided about its application to tainted groundwater. As a result, problems from industrial pollution and untreated sewage have persisted. The water quality problem is acute in Suffolk County. With 360,000 septic systems, Suffolk has roughly the same number as all of New Jersey. For years, nitrogen from leaky septic tanks has seeped into groundwater and eventually into rivers and bays. “What we have been doing for decades is just managing the decline of water quality,” said Steven Bellone, the Suffolk County executive. “Every water body is listed as impaired. We have dead rivers, closed beaches, harmful algal blooms. Before signing the law on Long Island in late April, Mr. Cuomo noted that a quarter of New York’s 610 sewage treatment plants were operating past their useful life. “We’re living off the legacy not of our parents but of our grandparents,” he said. The new state act, which spans five years, will among other things provide $1.5 billion in grants for water infrastructure improvements, $75 million in rebates to help homeowners replace septic systems and $110 million to protect land in watersheds. The money significantly expands a similar state infrastructure fund that over the last few years made $400 million available to communities. In addition to the new water infrastructure financing, the state budget allotted $40 million to build two sewer systems in business districts on the North Shore in Suffolk County. And there was $5 million for Suffolk County and the Center for Clean Water Technology at Stony Brook University to develop new methods of removing contaminants from drinking water. While it was one of the more significant investments to emerge from the state budget, some say it should be viewed as a down payment. Steve Englebright, a state assemblyman who heads the Environmental Conservation Committee, has said $80 billion to $100 billion is required to address the state’s aging water infrastructure. On Long Island, which is already grappling with hazardous waste at scores of active Superfund sites, the geology poses special challenges. With scant wastewater treatment, Suffolk County sits atop an aquifer that provides virtually all of its drinking water, and the sandy soil allows nitrogen to seep into it. Nassau County, just west of Suffolk, has many more homes using sewers than Suffolk, where 75 percent of the population relies on septic systems. The main reason that a county as populous as Suffolk has remained on septic systems, county officials say, is the legacy of the last attempt at installing a system — the infamous Southwest Sewer District. The sewer system, covering parts of the towns of Islip and Babylon, was eventually built. But the project, which started coming on line in 1981, became so mired in corruption, delays and cost overruns that it spooked future elected officials. “It was the biggest scandal in the county’s history,” Mr. Bellone said. “The appetite politically to do anything on this issue was nonexistent after that. It effectively killed sewering here for decades.” Suffolk County is eager to catch up to Nassau on wastewater treatment, but officials say new sewer systems are prohibitively expensive. One project on the drawing board, for instance, will cover about 8,200 parcels bordering four rivers that feed into the Great South Bay. The price tag is $383 million. Instead, the county’s strategy is to coax homeowners to replace antiquated septic tanks with high-tech “denitrification systems” — small units that cost more than older septic systems but remove most of the nitrogen from wastewater. Mr. Bellone said Suffolk hoped to tap the new state fund to help property owners acquire the systems. The same article can be summarized very efficiently in a pollution flow chart illustrated in Figure 1.1. The causes of this pollution are leaky and dysfunctional septic tanks. The results are that untreated nitrogen finds its way through the groundwater (GW), which is the vector in this article. The article mentions two receiving bodies: the bay and the aquifer. There are potential health risks associated with too much nitrogen added in the aquifer which serves as a drinking water supply (e.g., drinking water limit in the US for nitrate is 10 mg N/L). The article particularly insists on the fact that much of the excess nitrogen finds its way to rivers and end up in the Great South Bay, where algal blooms form. The consequences of the algal blooms are all linked to the depletion of oxygen generated from the large amount of organic matter decaying in the bay. Figure 1.1: Pollution flow chart for the article ‘Dead Rivers, Closed Beaches’: A Water Crisis on Long Island, published in the New York Times, in May 2017 This book aims at providing enough details about the important steps of this and other pollution flow charts. In particular, this book aims at providing the necessary knowledge for environmental scientists and engineers to be able to describe with confidence the processes and the actors at play in a generic pollution chart. As such this book addresses the conditions that lead to algal blooms, and provides enough phycology knowledge to describe the major bloom forming groups. The book particularly insists on the biogeochemical processes associated with eutrophication, which are very close to the ones at play in treatment systems naturally existing or man-designed to reduce pollutant loads closest to their source (Figure 1.2) Figure 1.2: Target areas and processes for this class in the pollution flow chart for the article ‘Dead Rivers, Closed Beaches’: A Water Crisis on Long Island 1.3 Scope of this book The scope of this book is to provide an ‘horizontal’ view across disciplines going from electron orbitals to removal efficacies at the treatment scale. For this, this book reviews and puts together into one ensemble the necessary knowledge from desciplines including chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, thermochemistry, modeling, and ecological engineering. The book first reviews the electron allocations on atoms and molecule, which are at the source of the generation and storage of energy in the biosphere. The book provides the necessary thermochemistry knowledge by introducing the notions of pH and pε and teaches how to draw pH-pε diagrams. The book presents the functioning of several treatment systems, and uses wetlands as a teaching model where most of the biogeochemical processes important in ecological engineering are present. The book presents process kinetics and models often applied in ecological engineering. 1.4 Exercises The goal of the exercises below is to draw pollution flow charts from articles published in the press and to realize that there always are at least a contaminant source, a vector, a receiving body, and environmental and health consequences. Not all elements are necessarily reported in all press articles, but they generally are. Good luck! Florida Red Tide: Wildlife Advocate Stunned by Toll on Fish By The Associated Press Aug. 22, 2018 ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — The head of one of the U.S.’s largest environmental nonprofits says he was stunned Wednesday to see thousands of dead fish and devastation to other marine life from a red tide off hugging southwest Florida’s Gulf Coast. Collin O’Mara, the president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, went on Wednesday with a charter boat captain in waters off Southwest Florida coast in the Sanibel Island area. He reported thousands and thousands of dead fish, eels and horseshoe crabs in the Gulf of Mexico. He also saw the carcasses of six-foot-long Goliath grouper fish. “I was astounded by the level of carnage that we saw,” said O’Mara. “Of all the disasters I’ve seen in the past decade, this is probably the most visual.” The toxic algae bloom has overrun Florida’s southern Gulf Coast this summer. It’s hugging much of Florida’s peninsula, from Naples in the south to Bradenton some 150 miles north. Red tide is a natural occurrence that happens due to the presence of nutrients in salt water and an organism called a dinoflagellate. This bloom started in November. The last toxic bloom in the Gulf happened between 2004-2006. The algae bloom can cause breathing problems in some people, and because of the smell left behind by the dead fish, has cleared vacationers from some tourist areas. But the main impact has been on the wildlife, and experts are concerned. “It was actually pretty overwhelming being there,” said O’Mara, who also toured another part of the state on Wednesday to look at a different algae crisis. He visited areas affected by blue-green algae, which is in freshwater. Heavy May rains caused Lake Okeechobee to discharge water containing blue-green algae into rivers and canals. The bright green sludge oozed onto docks, dams and rivers. People often get the two algae confused, because they’re occurring simultaneously, and in some cases, in the same county. The red tide algae in the Gulf has killed at least 452 sea turtles, nearly 100 manatees, 11 dolphins and tons of fish. County maintenance crews have had to use backhoes to scoop up all the dead marine life on the beaches. Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in seven counties along Florida’s Gulf that have been overrun by the pungent bloom. He also ordered $1.5 million to be spent on various clean-up efforts and to help business impacted by dwindling tourists. By The Editorial Board Oct. 25, 2016 North Carolina’s Noxious Pig Farms The landscape of eastern North Carolina is dotted with giant pools of bright pink sludge. These are waste lagoons, where industrial farms across the state dispose of billions of gallons of untreated pig urine and feces every year. The waste can carry E. coli, salmonella, cryptosporidium and other bacteria that can lead to serious illness or death if they spread to humans. After Hurricane Matthew deluged North Carolina this month, at least 14 of the lagoons flooded. Environmental advocates and state officials have been flying over regions to identify overflowing lagoons where floodwaters have become mixed with the waste, a public health hazard that could last for weeks as bacteria flow into rivers and streams, potentially sickening those who come into contact with those waters. Bacteria can also contaminate groundwater, the main source of drinking water for more than three million North Carolinians. Meanwhile, the nitrogen and phosphorus in hog waste can kill fish and damage ecosystems. State officials are now beginning to test rivers to assess the level of contamination. In states where hog farmers use waste lagoons, like North Carolina and Illinois, flooding is a serious hazard that may become more frequent as climate change leads to more severe storms. Even under normal conditions, lagoons can produce dangerous gases, noxious smells and dust containing hog waste. People living near these lagoons are at increased risk of asthma, diarrhea, eye irritation, depression and other health problems. A research program at North Carolina State University has found several safer waste-disposal methods, including one that converts nitrogen in waste into harmless nitrogen gas and uses another process to eliminate harmful bacteria. North Carolina took steps toward protecting its residents by passing a moratorium on new lagoons in 1997 and making it permanent in 2007. But around 4,000 lagoons constructed before 1997 remain in active use. Unless North Carolina and other states require agriculture companies to change their waste-disposal methods, what happened after Hurricane Matthew will happen again. References "],

We have also seen that these three challenges are inter-connected and related. Nutrients and organic matter are related because the former contain the needed atoms necessary to build living cell and organism structures, corresponding to living organic matter, while the latter generally refers to dead organic matter and/or the assemblage of molecules which at one point were part of a living organism. This definition of the linkage between the two is hardly satisfying, however… When one looks at where the electrons are allocated on the important atoms, a much more unifying scheme appears. This chapter describes this unifying scheme. 2.1 The five fundamental requirements of life Before we dive down to the electron level, let us make sure we recognize that it is possible to simplify why there is, or not, life on our planet and the universe. Such a list includes: the presence of liquid water available nutrients that can fulfill the need for the six most numerous and important atoms that build most of our cell and organism structure: C, H, O, N, S, P. Without the commas comes this delightful acronym CHONSP which generations of students have come to love a source of energy, which in most cases is the form of solar or chemical energy electrons acceptor(s), without which chemical energy cannot be released and a suitable temperature range (about -5°C to +50°C) because of course most of living organisms will not live for very long outside this range There are many other requirements for life to occur, e.g., the ability to reproduce or even to die, but for what we are interested, this is a satisfying list. In this chapter, we will address the source of energy and what secret living organisms have found to store energy. Primary producers, which include most of chlorophyll containing plants from algae to angiosperms (flowering plants), have the ability to use solar radiations as a source of energy. An entire chapter is dedicated to this marvel. However, even for primary producers, solar radiations cannot be the sole source of energy, otherwise they would die at night… And for the rest of living organisms, solar radiations are just not a source of energy (merely a source of ‘bien-être’ or vitamin D for humans…!). So obviously, life has had to find a solution so that energy would be available for all conditions of light and temperature on earth. The first secret of life is the ability to store energy in the form of high energy electrons onto organic molecules. Having a source of energy is always a good thing. However, energy can only be released if there is an outlet for it, otherwise it stays as potential energy. Practically, this means that the energy stored on organic molecules can and is only released when the electrons go from the high potential to a lower one, or in others words from electron donors (most of the time from organic molecules) to electron acceptors. This is the second secret of life on earth: on our planet exists this miracle molecule, O2, which acts as an extremely powerful electron acceptor. So you have to imagine O2 less as a gentle acceptor of electrons that organic matter would be kind enough to donate, but more like a very aggressive electron seeker and any organic matter located close to oxygen runs the risk to be oxidized, that is to lose its electrons. Sometimes, I like to refer to O2 as the electron kleptomaniac. So in oxygenated environments such as earth’s atmosphere and most water bodies, living organisms’ only concern is to have potential energy available in the form of high energy electrons stored onto organic molecules, because this energy can easily be released at any time thanks to the very oxidizing agent O2. Chapter ?? goes into the details of how this energy is released and transferred in cells. 2.2 Electron allocation onto CHONSP First, among the 6 atoms that form CHONSP, and this is true for all atoms except for noble gases which are stable monatomic atoms, none of them exist as monatomic atoms: they always form bonds with other atoms to form molecules. Among the CHONSP, three of them are homonuclear diatomic molecules, i.e., they can form molecules of two atoms of the same chemical element: H2 (dihydrogen, although it is most often referred to simply as hydrogen, which can be quite confusing), O2 (dioxygen, although oxygen is also most often used, unfortunately), and N2 (dinitrogen, which name is generally properly applied). Obviously, they can also bind to other elements, which is what we are about to see. If indeed, on our planet floats a very oxidizing agent in the form of O2, then the stable state of all other molecules should be where most other elements have lost all their electrons to oxygen. And there ought to be techniques to see where the electrons are allocated on molecules. 2.3 Electronegativity as a powerful tool to allocate electrons Chemists have created the oxidation state (OS) or oxidation number indicator which quantifies this electron allocation to some extent, but we find it to be rather confusing for our purpose of allocating or view where the electrons are Stored in molecules. More discussion and information on Oxidation State is available in the glossary of this book. We must first lock in the electronegativity concept. Electronegativity is a chemical property which describes how well an atom can attract an electron to itself. In the periodic table in Figure 2.1, first observe that our CHONSP all belong to the non-metallic atoms. Figure 2.1: Vibrant Periodic Table With 118 Elements. Obtained freely from https://sciencenotes.org/periodic-table-pdf-2/ Second, all atoms are more or less electronegative. The most electronegative atom is F, fluorine. Electronegativity decreases towards the left and the bottom of the table as illustrated in Figure 2.2. For our CHONSP, ElecNegO &gt; ElecNegN &gt; ElecNegS &gt; ElecNegC &gt; ElecNegH &gt; ElecNegP. Figure 2.2: Periodic table of the elements with electronegativities shown. Obtained freely from https://sciencenotes.org/list-of-electronegativity-values-of-the-elements/ If you look carefully in Figure 2.2 and in equation (2.1), you will see that the electronegativity of oxygen is 3.44, which is a lot greater than that of N (3.04), and the difference between N and C and S, is about 0.5. In other words, all the CHNSP stand no chance next to O: in any molecule which may involve CHNSP, the O atom will attract the electrons for itself. \\[\\begin{align} O \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; N \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; S \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; C \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; H \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; P \\\\ 3.44 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 3.05 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.58 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.56 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.30 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.19 \\tag{2.1} \\end{align}\\] For example, in the H2O molecule, one can see in the Lewis dot Structure below that by applying the electronegativity rule, the O atom has all the electrons for itself, while the 2 H, have none for themselves. Let us make sure that there is no confusion between the octet rule and the electronegativity. Atoms assemble into molecules so that their octet rules be fulfilled. So in the H2O molecule, yes each H shares an electron with the O and reciprocally. But, the electronegativity tells us which atom really has the electrons for itself. And that atom is O. Figure 2.3: Electron allocation on the water molecule following the electronegativity rule We realize that the electron allocation can be quite confusing or a bit artificial at first, but we shall see in Chapter ?? that it is fully corroborated with oxidation and reduction processes. You can now see in equation (2.1), that sulfur and carbon nearly have the same electronegativity, which is one of the reasons for the ease of formation of the disulfur bridges in proteins. Also notice that phosphorus has the lowest electronegativity of our CHONSP, and this is the reason why, as we shall see later, phosphorus stays in the oxidized form, even in organic molecules. 2.4 Dioxygen: the ‘electron kleptomaniac’ molecule Oxygen is a homonuclear diatomic molecules, which means that it can form the diatomic molecule O2. The two atoms of Oxygen, having the same electronegativity, split the electrons, which means that each atom has 6 electrons for itself as shown in Figure 2.4. So if we summarize things, we have the most electronegative atom in the universe after Fluorine (Figure 2.2) that is floating in most places on earth and in water essentially in a state (O2) where it really would rather have 8 rather than 6 electron for itself! This is the reason why oxygen is the ultimate electron acceptor, although a better representation might be to describe it as the ultimate ‘electron kleptomaniac’. Figure 2.4: Electron allocation on the water molecule following the electronegativity rule But let us be clear: the oxygen atom can only be an electron acceptor if it does not have 8 electrons for itself. The only two possibilities are in the case of O2, for which each atom as 6 electrons for itself, and the other possibility is for hydrogen peroxide \\(H-O-O-H\\), where each oxygen atom have 7 electrons for themselves. Because oxygen is the most electronegative atom (after fluorine), in all other molecules where it is involved, oxygen will have 8 electrons for itself, and can therefore never accept more electrons. 2.5 Fully Oxidized forms of CNSP On our planet, we have the luxury to ‘bath’ in an oxidized environment, which means among other things, that the oxygen atom will tend to attract all the electrons for itself when involved with CHNSP. Another way to look at it is to say that the stable state in an aerobic environment of the CHNSP atoms corresponds to molecules where the CHNSP atoms will have zero electrons for themselves. Well, and guess what, there are not that many possibilities, in fact only one for each of the CNSP atoms! In Figure 2.5 below, you can see that none of the CNSP atoms have electrons for themselves: they have all been taken by the oxygen atoms! Figure 2.5: Electron allocation on each of the C, N, S, and P atoms for the CO2, nitrate, sulfate, and phosphate molecules, showing that C, N, S, and P atoms have no electrons for themselves, or are fully oxidized, while Oxygen has 8, or is fully reduced As a result, these molecules are deemed as stable in an aerobic environment. This suggests that all other molecules containing CNSP are essentially unstable on our planet…?! Yes, you read it correctly, that is the case! Honestly, there is nothing new really as this has been written a long time ago, e.g., in the Christian Bible “you are dust and to dust you will return” (Gn 3:19). So we essentially have a reprieve on this planet, but so do all living creatures!! The secret of life has been to be able to create and maintain CNSP atoms with electron for themselves, very well ‘knowing’ that these electrons would eventually be stripped away by O2, but living organisms take advantage of this because the transfer of electrons generates energy (see Chapter ??). Notice that the suffix of the oxidized forms of N, S, and P, is -ate. The exception appears to be CO2, which is a gas while the -ate molecules are dissolved ions. However, the ionic forms of dissolved CO2 are bicarbonate and carbonate, which suffix is -ate. So everything is logical in the end. To be complete, all the fully oxidized forms of CNSP, may lose of gain protons H+ depending on the pH. It turns out that for the pH range encountered in most natural waters (3.5 &lt; pH &lt; 9), only the carbonates and the phosphates may have different molecular formulae. So the fully oxidized forms of C in inorganic molecules are illustrated in Figure 2.6 below (aditional details available in the glossary): Figure 2.6: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of C, including from left to right CO2, carbonic acid, hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate), and carbonate, showing that the C atoms have no electrons for themselves The fully oxidized forms of P in inorganic molecules are illustrated in Figure 2.7 below (aditional details available in the glossary): Figure 2.7: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of P, including from left to right Phosphoric acid, dihydrogen Phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, and phosphate , showing that the P atoms have no electrons for themselves 2.6 Oxidation versus Reduction But if O2 wants electrons so badly from any atom, how come all living creature do not just turn into ‘dust’, i.e., carbon dioxide, nitrate, sulfate and phosphate, all the time and manage to live at all?? A minimum ‘energy obstacle’ must be overcome for electrons to be transferred: this is referred to as the activation energy (see Chapter ??). This obstacle is overcome during combustion: the high temperature of a flame self propagates the transfer of electrons from organic matter to O2. Chapter ?? provides in great details how living organisms manage to allow enough transfer of electrons to generate energy, without turning into ‘dust’ at once like in combustion. Yet, when an organism dies, all the electrons stored onto the organic molecules are eventually taken by oxygen in an aerobic environment. We have now established that oxygen eventually takes all electrons, but for that to happen, a minimum energy obstable must be overcome. This opens the possibility for CNSP to, at least temporarily, have electrons for themselves. This also opens the possibility to an infinite number of possible combinations of CHONSP assemblages in nature. Before we get there though, it is time to establish some important terms. The fact that the oxygen atom tends to strip all electrons for itself is referred to as oxidation. This terms comes from the early days of chemistry referring to reactions where oxygen was involved. We now know that oxygen is not necessarily the only one involved in loss of electrons. By extention, any atom which loses electrons, not necessarily to O2, is said to be oxidized. Reversely, an atom which gains electrons is said to be reduced or to undergo reduction. This term also comes from the early days of chemistry when Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794) observed that the weight of a heated metallic ore diminished due to the loss of dioxygen as a gas; and the metallic ore appeared reduced in size and in weight (Wikipedia contributors 2018f). We now know that this corresponds to the acquisition of electrons, hence the word reduction for the gain of electrons. Several mnemonics exist in English to associate electron loss/gain with oxidation/reduction: LEO (Loss of Electrons is Oxidation) the lion says GER (Gain of Electrons is Reduction)! OIL RIG: Oxidation Is Loss (of electrons) Reduction Is Gain (of electrons) When oxygen takes electrons from another atom, we say that oxygen has been reduced, while the other atom has been oxidized. An oxidation is necessarily accompanied with a reduction, as electrons do not ‘float’ in solution like protons do. When the CNSP atoms have lost all their electrons like in Figure 2.5, we say that the CNSP atoms are fully oxidized. Fully reduced atoms have 8 electrons for themselves, as is the case for oxygen in carbon dioxide (and carbonates), nitrate, sulfate, and phosphates. This suggests that between fully oxidized and fully reduced, there might be cases where atoms are partially oxidized and reduced. 2.7 A gradient of oxidation and reduction states on inorganic and organic molecules Indeed, whether CNSP atoms have 1, 2, etc. to 8 electrons for themselves, they will form very different molecules. It is now time to define what organic vs. inorganic molecules are. The term organic molecule finds its roots in vitalism, where it was believed that the elements entering in the composition of living organisms had to be different to the ones that made inanimate things. The term organic has remained and a more modern definition is that an organic molecule is a molecule where there is at least one \\(C-C\\) bond. The best definition of an inorganic molecule is a molecule that is not organic. One of the most important things to understand and learn in this part is that it is the electron allocation which essentially defines what a molecule will be. For example, molecules such as carbon dioxide CO2 and methane CH4 are quite different, one involves oxygen, the other hydrogen atoms. But in reality, one can make sense of the difference by looking at how many electrons the C has for itself. When C has zero electrons for itself, this means that some other electrons have stolen all the electrons from C, and there are not that many possibilities out there. The obvious solution is O=C=O or CO2 and the carbonates (Figure 2.6). For the record, there are at least two other inorganic molecules that exist out there for which C has zero electrons for itself, but they are, relatively, in minuscule quantities : cyanate (N≡C-O-) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). So it is fair to say the ‘only’ molecules with zero electrons is CO2 and carbonates for environmental and ecological applications. Reversely, the only molecule with 8 electrons for itself is a molecule where all the other atoms bound to the C atom give their electrons away. The only atom that will do this is hydrogen, so the only possible molecule with a C atom is methane CH4. In other words, it is quite interesting to look at molecules from the stand point of the number of electrons atoms have for themselves, and conclude on the different possibilities of molecules. Obviously, the examples of CO2 and CH4 are simplistic because they are simple inorganic molecules. Two other simple examples but that matter very much in our field, are nitrate vs. ammonium, and sulfate vs. sulfide. S and N in Sulfate and nitrate having no electron for themselves, the obvious electron ‘stealer’ is oxygen, hence the NO3- and SO42- formulae. In NH4+ and H2S, the S and N have 8 electrons from themselves (Table 2.1) and naturally, hydrogen atoms are providing electrons. Overall, across organic and inorganic moelecules, there is an entire gradient of oxidation states or number of electrons allocated on the C, N, and S (Table 2.1). Notice that I purposely ommitted to mention P here, because the only form of P relevant for environmental and ecological engineering are the phosphates. And we have seen that in the phosphate molecules, P always has zero electrons for itself. It is therefore always in an oxidized form (Figure 2.7). Table 2.1 summarizes a gradient of electron allocations, or a gradient of oxidation and reduction states, on the CNSP atoms. It is important to notice several things: Carbon is the only atom with a variable number of electrons in organic molecules N, and S, always have 8 electrons for themselves in organic molecules This suggests that carbon is quite a variable of adjustment for electron ‘acquisition’ and ‘donation’ This is why C is the atom on which photosynthesis can store, as the first step, electrons, and not any other atom Because C can adjust so easily, reversely, N and S, although in a fully reduced state in organic molecule, will just not give their electrons in an environment where C can do that for them first. As a result, and this is crucial for our field, the byproduct of the oxidation of organic matter in respiration (details in Chapter ??) are reduced and are NH4+ and H2S, as they do not get oxidized during heterotrophic respiration. Notice that only in inorganic molecules, do the N and S, have variable oxidation states, or number of allocated electrons on them. Nitrite has two electrons for itself, and is highly unstable in aerobic environments, as oxygen will try to steal its electrons. Sulfur dioxide and sulfite also are in very small quantities in the atmosphere (SO2) or in water as HSO3- (not represented in Table 2.1) and SO32-, as both will readily be oxidated in sulfuric acid and sulfate. Notice that N2 has 5 electrons for itself, which is quite a lot and, therefore, potentially is an important electron donor. However, the triple bond N≡N is very difficult to break and O2 does not, even at high temperatures. As a result, N≡N is an inert or unreactive gas, although it makes for about 78% of earth’s atmosphere. Nitrogen in N2 is thus referred to as unreactive nitrogen.

Let us take the example of glucose. Glucose is the result molecule of photosynthesis, where electrons have been stored onto the carbon atoms, which originally contained none as the nutrient from which glucose molecule is assembled is CO2. How can one see this? In the equation (2.2)! Additional details on redox half-reactions are provided in the glossary. What is important to see here is that: 24 electrons are necessary to built glucose from CO2 that these 24 electrons originally come from the oxygen atom of H2O that as oxygen atoms from water lose electrons, they form O2, where each atom has only 6 electrons for itself (Figure 2.4) \\[\\begin{align} 6\\,CO_2 + 24\\,H^+ + 24\\,e^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\\,H_2O\\\\ 12\\,H_2O &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; 6\\,O_2 + 24\\,H^+ + 24\\,e^-\\\\ &amp; &amp;\\\\ \\hline\\\\ 6\\,CO_2 + 6\\,H_2O &amp; \\to &amp; C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\\,O_2 \\tag{2.2} \\end{align}\\] After what we have said about oxygen and its prepensity to steal all electrons, why would it suddenly give electrons to C to form glucose? Indeed, there is some magic involved and it is called photosynthesis! For this to happen, magic catalysts able to steal the electrons from oxygen of H2O, and a lot of energy captured in the form of light are necessary! And indeed in the end, thanks to the electron allocation concept, it is possible to visualize onto the glucose molecule where the electrons are as illustrated in Figure 2.8. Figure 2.8: Electron allocation on the glucose molecule showing that the C atoms have 3 to 5, and an average of 4 electrons for themselves So, hopefully you are now convinced thanks to both the equations and Figure 2.8 that indeed electrons are stored onto organic molecules! Notice that four of the C atoms have 4 electrons for themselves, while one has 3 and the last one has 5. On average though, each atom has 4. This actually is quite interesting as it corresponds to the number of electrons C has on its free form. This means that photosynthesis is not ‘trying’ to store more electrons than what it has in its free form: this is probably a lot more efficient than if it tried to store 6 like for the lipids (see Table 2.1 and Chapter 3), and yet provides an opportunity to store a lot of electrons. Let us take another example with cysteine, which also has N and S atoms in it. You can see in Figure 2.9 that the N and S atoms have 8 electrons for themselves, while the C atoms have 1, 4 and 5 electron for themselves. Cysteine has thus stored a total of 28 electrons for a total of 5 CNS atoms or 40% more electrons per atom than glucose. Figure 2.9: Electron allocation on the cysteine molecule showing the number of electrons stored on the C, N and S atoms For an alga who would use nitrate, sulfate and bicarbonates as its nutrients and which would need to anabolize cysteine, it would require to find 28 electrons and energy to assemble cysteine, as no electrons come with the nutrients listed here. Interestingly, the electrons stored on N and S are not useful as a source of electrons in the respiration chain of heterotrophic respiration. But the N and S atoms, which respectively appear as amine (-NH2) and thiol (-SH) radicals for cysteine in Figure 2.9 play a central role in the formation and information molecules which contain N and S have for the cell. This is what the next chapter is going to show. The last example is ATP (Adenosine TriPhosphate), illustrated in Figure 2.10. You can see that there are lots of red dots on the triphosphate side of the molecule, and see that phosphorus has zero electrons for itself…! Chapter ?? details the reasons how and why ATP carries energy. But here, one can see that surely, it is not thanks to electrons on P, since there are none! The triphosphate chain is bound to a ribose, itself bound to an adenine. Ribose + Adenine is called adenosine. On ribose, each carbon stores an average of 4 electrons like all carbohydrates. There are lots of electrons stored on the 5 atoms of nitrogen on adenine. But these are not used for generating energy in the respiration chain. The large number of N atoms and electrons seem to be associated with highly valued molecules as ATP certainly is. Figure 2.10: Electron allocation on the ATP molecule showing the number of electrons stored on the C, N, and P atoms Last but important point. It is possible that some of you are still wondering why the electrons on oxygen are not counted as the number of electrons stored on molecules, and particularly on organic molecules. Oxygen, outside of the O2 molecule, really ‘steals’ electrons from all other atoms, as we have now repeated quite a few times. So when these molecules are anabolized from molecules such as carbonate, nitrate, sulfate or phosphate, each oxygen atom is already loaded with 8 electrons. So, it cannot accept any additional ones. So each oxygen atom in organic and inorganic molecule, is not bringing any electron ‘to the table’. The only changes can occur on the C, N, and S atoms. 2.9 Summary on electron allocations This concludes the chapter on electron allocation, and the first introduction to oxidation and reduction. We have learned that using the electron allocation rooted in the electronegativitiy concept, it is possible to visualize where the electrons are stored and realize that in the vast majority of the time: oxygen steal all electrons for itself and is fully reduced, unless it is in the form of O2, where it become very ‘hungry’ for electrons hydrogen being less electronegative, always gives its electron to CONS atoms Life’s secret to storing energy boils down to having high energy electrons stored on C, N, and S atoms, although only the C atoms are the ones that easily accept or donate electrons. Phosphorus almost always remains as in the fully oxidized forms of phosphates (or polyphosphates), even when incorporated in organic molecules as we shall see in the next chapter. This is due to the fact that phosphorus’ electronegativity is lower than that of hydrogen. Phosphate plays a crucial role in energy conveyance, however, thanks to the pyrophosphate bond. The next step consists in presenting where and why organisms need N, S, and P, to build their structure. The next chapter presents the four molecular families with which all organisms, and therefore organic matter, are assembled. References "],

Complex molecules are polymers of simple monomers Each molecular family has specific structure to achieve specific function. Details of each are summarized in this chapter In organic molecules, about 4 electrons are stored on each carbon atom, none on the phosphorus, and always 8 electrons on the nitrogen and sulfur atoms 3.1 Polymers of simple monomers When scientists of the 18th century observed nature, they thought there had to be major differences between animated organisms and the inanimate ones. In fact they thought that the elements at the basis of the animated vs. inanimate things had to be different. One can only wonder at the incredible diversity and complexity of forms between a bacterium and humans, and between unicellular algae and sequoia trees! And yet, despite the incredible variations of life forms and sizes, there is a common theme: very complex organic molecules are polymers of relatively simple monomers. In the image of a brick wall and the skyscraper in Figure 3.1, it is possible to make a small wall or a huge skyscraper. Brick walls are made of bricks and of mortar to hold the bricks together. If one adds metal pieces, wood, etc. the complexity of the final product can be infinite, yet it is made from simple elementary pieces. Figure 3.1: Small and large structures can be built from the addition of bricks, one at a time Living organisms are essentially made of very complex polymers, but which are all built from simple monomers. Just like in a building which complexity results from the assemblage of different types of material, e.g., bricks, wood, metal, etc., living organisms are assembled from distinct ‘types of molecules’. Among the very complex organic polymers, one can distinguish four molecular families (in addition to what we refer to as co-enzymes), where in each family, there is a repeated pattern. A molecular family can be defined as polymers of similar monomers within a family but distinct between families a mortar or chemical bonds which binds monomers together The four molecular families that make organic molecules include: Carbohydrates Proteins Nucleic acids Lipids 3.2 Carbohydrates Carbohydrates form the entry molecules onto which electrons are first stored in photosynthesis, and precisely on the carbon atoms. The generic formula for carbohydrates is (CH2O)n, and each atom, on average, has 4 electrons for itself as illustrated in Figure 3.2. We have seen in the previous chapter that having 4 electrons stored on each C is probably the most cost effective way to store many electrons on organic molecules. Figure 3.2: Electron allocation of a generic carbohydrate (CH2O)n 3.2.1 Monosaccharides The monomers of carbohydrates are called monosaccharides (from Greek monos, i.e., single, and sacchar, sugar) or sometimes called simple sugars or oses (from the Latin “full of, abounding in, having qualities of”). The monomers that are assembled into complex polymers generally are hexoses, that is that they have 6 carbons, and are isomers of glucose. However, monosaccharides do include more than just hexoses or C6H12O6, and it is important to present them in general, and not just the monomers of polysaccharides. Most monosaccharides are made of 3 to 6 carbons (there actually are C7 to C9 oses) and are classified in aldoses or ketoses, depending on whether they have a aldehyde (-CHO) on their C#1 or a ketone (C=O) radical, usually on the carbon numbered #2. They either exist in linear chains and are then represented in Fischer projection like in Figures 3.3 and 3.4, or, for pentoses (C5) and hexoses (C6), exist in cyclic chains (Figures 3.6 and 3.5). Carbohydrates have been given a lot of codes and naming conventions and it is hard to avoid them if we want to put things together. So, do not be scared by all the names and letters used to describe and differentiate carbohydrates. The goal is: to realize the large diversity of monosaccharides to realize that the differences between, e.g., the hexoses are of steric consideration, i.e., which side are the hydroxyl (-OH) groups are of the linear chain, right or left. to realize that C5 and C6 carbohydrates alternate between chain and cyclic molecular configurations. The cyclic form prevails for the functions of transport and structure that the carbohydrates provide. The chain form is the form needed for the release of electrons and energy. Both forms interchange freely for monosaccharides. Figure 3.3: classification of C3 to C6 aldoses in Fischer projection. Triose : (1) D-(+)-glyceraldehyde ; Tetroses : (2a) D-(−)-erythrose ; (2b) D-(−)-threose ; Pentoses : (3a) D-(−)-ribose ; (3b) D-(−)-arabinose ; (3c) D-(+)-xylose ; (3d) D-(−)-lyxose ; Hexoses : (4a) D-(+)-allose ; (4b) D-(+)-altrose ; (4c) D-(+)-glucose ; (4d) D-(+)-mannose ; (4e) D-(−)-gulose ; (4f) D-(−)-idose ; (4g) D-(+)-galactose ; (4h) D-(+)-talose. after Yikrazuul — personal work, public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4030124 Time to incorporate some jargon. When in the chain form necessary for the carbons to donate their electrons, monosaccharides are called reducing sugars. This means that they are able to donate their electrons, to drive respiration and the generation of energy in the cell (details in Chapter ??). So, despite the fact that each carbon atom on monosaccharides has 4 electrons to give, potentially, this does not systematically happen. Strange, is it not? Indeed, for the pentoses and hexoses to be reducing sugars, they must be in the aldose form, or have a free aldehyde at the end of their chain or on carbon #1. So this rules out the ketoses? Actually no, the ketoses in the chain form can be readily tautomerized into aldoses. This is only important to explain some of the differences in disaccharides. Figure 3.4: classification of C3 to C6 ketoses in Fischer projection. Triose : (1) dihydroxyacetone ; Tetrose : (2) D-erythrulose ; Pentoses : (3a) D-ribulose ; (3b) D-xylulose ; Hexoses : (4a) D-psicose ; (4b) D-fructose ; (4c) D-sorbose ; (4d) D-tagatose. after Yikrazuul — personal work, public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6603584 You might wonder what the D-(+) or D-(-) might mean in the legends of Figures 3.3 and 3.4… This is due to optical rotation properties that a pure solution of a particular ose has because of the asymmetry of the molecules. The different forms of hexoses in, e.g., Figure 3.3 are called eniantiomers. D means that the hydroxyl group on the C#n-1 to the right of the molecule and most natural oses tend to be D (few oses have it on the left, in which case they are coded as L). The (+) or (-) tell whether the light rotation is pulled towards positive or negative angles. OK, lots of terms here, mostly to quench some of the curiosity of the biochemist in you. Now that we have a more holistic view of what monosaccharides are made of, for all our purposes, we will reduce all this great variability to a few of them, which are glyceraldehyde (C3), ribose and deoxyribose (C5), and, glucose and fructose (C6). Glyceraldehyde is an important intermediate molecule of photosynthesis. Figure 3.5: Cyclic structure or Haworth projection of alpha-D-glucopyranose (alpha-D-glucose; left) and beta-D-fructofuranose (beta-D-fructose; right) As previously mentioned, pentoses and hexoses have the tendency to form cyclic or ring molecules ‘through a nucleophilic addition reaction between the carbonyl group and one of the hydroxyls of the same molecule. The reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging oxygen atom’ (Wikipedia contributors 2018e). The most common rings are made of 5 or 6 atoms, respectively with four C atoms and one O atom, and, five C atoms and one O atom (cyclic forms also referred to as furanose and pyranose, respectively, because they closely resemble furan, and pyran rings). In Figure 3.5, both glucose and fructose are hexoses. But fructose generally forms furanose rings (5 atoms, including one oxygen atom), while glucose forms pyranose rings. The α and β correspond to whether the hydroxyl on the C#1 atom is below (α) or above (β) the plan made by the ring. Some more jargon here added for exactness of information only. Figure 3.6: Cyclic structure of beta-D-Ribofuranose (beta-D-ribose) and 2-deoxyribose Ribose and deoxyribose are the most important pentoses we need to know as they constitute one of the three ensembles that constitute nucleotides, i.e., the monomers of nucleic acids. They both exist either in furanose or pyranose forms, although the furanose form dominates, but the difference between ribose and deoxyribose is the missing oxygen atom on the C2’ atom (Figure 3.6). And yes, you guessed it right, this difference is the reason for the ‘R’ and ‘D’ in the RNA and DNA molecules. Notice that the carbon atoms are numbered in Figures 3.5 and 3.6. The numbers are ‘primed’ for the ribose and deoxyribose (Figure 3.6). This is a convention that geneticians have used to differentiate the carbons from the pentose to those of the base in nucleotides (see part on nucleic acids). This is anecdotal information again. Now, as the pentoses and hexoses form rings, an interesting group appears and is referred to as the acetal group. Yet another term needed to understand some of the subtleties of the functions of the di- and polysaccharides… For the aldohexoses to form rings, the aldehyde on carbon #1 (Figures 3.3) reacts with the hydroxyl of carbon #5 to form a 6 atom ring (e.g. for glucose on Figure 3.5). And in can easily revert to the chain structure to have a free aldehyde again and be a reducing sugar. For fructose, a ketohexose, the ketone from carbon #2, reacts with the hydroxyl of also carbon #5, to now form a 5 atom ring (Fructose on Figure 3.5). So why is this important enough to be mentioned here…? In the ring versions of the glucose and fructose, the carbons #1 and #2 now have single bounds with two oxygen atoms. This group formed by a central carbon, and bonds in a tetrahedral as illustrated in Figure 3.7 is a rather special bond. In fact, special enough that it has some interesting consequences, with two different forms. If one of the atoms bound to oxygen is different than hydrogen (e.g., R’ and R&quot; in Figure 3.7 both not H), then this group is called an acetal group, and the bond is a rather stable bond. If one of the R’ or R&quot; in Figure 3.7 is H, while the other has some other radical, then the structure becomes asymetric, the group formed is then called hemiacetal as is not nearly as stable, which explains why the hexoses so easily switch from the linear chain to the cyclic configurations. This hemiacetal group is one of the basis of the glycosidic bond, which binds the cyclic pentoses and hexoses in di- and polysaccharides, but also with other molecules. Figure 3.7: Structure of a generic acetal By NEUROtiker - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3508032 So, what is there to remember about monosaccharides? Their formula is (CH2O)n where 3 &lt; n &lt; 6 generally The C3 atom monosaccharide to remember is glyceraldehyde Small differences in the position of hydroxyl, and in the cyclisation of the C5 and C6 make for different monosaccharides Each atom has on average 4 electrons for itself, making monosaccharides the ideal molecule to store and release energy electrons, although they have to be in the aldose chain form Thanks to all the hydroxyl groups, monosaccharides are extremely soluble in water. Glucose is arguably the most important monosaccharide and the only hexose molecule you are expected to know how to draw For glucose, and for organic chemistry in general, there are several ways of representing molecules. One of the ways is the Haworth projection as shown in Figures 3.5 and 3.6. Another way is called the Fischer projection as illustrated in Figures 3.3 and 3.4. Another way is called the skeletal formula where the carbons are implied at the corners and the ends of line segments, while oxygen and other remarkable radicals such as hydroxyl or amine are noted. Glucose is thus often represented as skeletal formula as the left in Figure 3.8. Another even more simplified representation of glucose is represented in the ‘hyper’ skeletal formula. The latter has the advantage to be simple enough to be used to illustrate polysaccharides. Figure 3.8: Skeletal formula for alpha-D-glucose (left) and ‘hyper’ skeletal formula (right) 3.2.2 Dissacharides Sucrose, lactose, and maltose are three common dissaccharides. Dissharides are bioses or polymers of two hexose monomers. Because they are still small, and thanks to their solubility in water (thanks to hydroxyl groups), they play an essential role to transport energy in chemical forms because for a slight increase of the osmotic pressure in a liquid, dissaccharides carry twice the number of electrons. Dissaccharides correspond to the assemblage of two monosaccharides thanks to the glycosidic bond. The name of this bond suggests that it is very specific to carbohydrates, and it is true as one monosaccharide must be involved in a glysidic bond. So the glycosidic bond is a type of covalent bond that joins a carbohydrate (sugar) molecule to another group, which may or may not be another carbohydrate. There are 4 types of glycosidic bonds, depending on the atom directly linked to the hemiacetal carbon of the carbohydrate: O-, N-, S-, or C-glycosidic bonds. Figure 3.9 illustrates the generic O- and N-glycosidic bond. Figure 3.9: Formation of glycosidic bonds between a hemiacetal Carbon and a hydroxyl or amine group, to respectively form O- and N-glycosidic bonds. The N-glycosidic bond occurs in nucleotides and thus plays a major role. But overall, the term glycosidic bond generally refers to the O-glycosidic bond between two consecutive monosaccharides (Figure 3.10). In the end, and to go back to the brick and mortar analogy, for di- and polysaccharides, the glycosidic bond is the equivalent of the mortar. Figure 3.10: Formation of glycosidic bonds between a glucose hemiacetal carbon and a methyl hydroxyde (top) or between two glucoses to form maltose Lactose and maltose (Figure 3.11) are dissaccharides, respectively assembled from a galactose and a glucose, and, from two glucose molecules. Notice that these two molecules are reducing sugars, i.e., there is one hemicetal carbon (C#1) free to potentially open one glucose into a chain form, hence the ability for both lactose and maltose to be readily available as electron donors. This is quite nice for lactose produced by mammal females to be readily available for their offsprings. On another note, during seed germination, starch (details below) is hydrolyzed into maltose first by the amylase enzyme, and then readily participate in energy generation for this critical time of seed plant lives. Figure 3.11: Lactose and maltose dissaccharides molecular formulae Interestingly, sucrose in not a reducing sugar as both hemiacetal carbons (C#1 of glucose, and C#2 of fructose) are part of the glycosidic bond (Figure 3.12). There are several advantages: Figure 3.12: Sucrose molecular formula Sucrose is a very stable molecule, and a lot more than lactose and maltose. Hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond is very slow and solutions of sucrose can last for a very long time. Because both hemiacetal carbons are bound, there are no more possibilities for an additional glycosidic bond to take place: sucrose stay as a dissaccharide This is actually essential for green vascular plants, which assemble sucrose in their leaves from glucose and fructose, but must transport these molecules away from the leaves for to minimize weight and avoid jamming of the photosynthesis. So having a very stable, highly soluble, none polymerisable, non reducing molecule is very advantageous. Sucrose can then be hydrolyzed thanks to the sucrase enzyme into glucose and fructose again for use or storage at other places in the plants. So what is there to remember? Dissacharides are small molecules which are easily soluble and easily transportable. For the a very similar osmotic pressure, dissaccharides carry twice as many electrons as monosaccharides: dissaccharides are the ‘go to’ transport molecules Sucrose is a non reducing sugar, which allows transportation of a precious cargo in sap very far from where it was produced (think about sequoias!) 3.2.3 Polyssaccharides Polysaccharides are polymers of monosaccharides linked together thanks to the glycosidic bond, forming sometimes very long chains (at least more than 10 monosaccharides, or else are referred to oligosaccharides), either linear or branched. Polysaccharides generally have two main functions: energy storage or structure. Because of the glycosidic bond, which removes a molecule of H2O, the general formula for a large polysaccharide is more like (C6H10O5)n often with 200 &lt; n &lt; 3500. For our purpose, it is important to rememver that there are three main polysaccharides (Figure 3.13): starch and glycogen, which are both energy storage molecules for plants, and animals, respectively, and, cellulose which has a structure function making a lot of the plants cell walls. Figure 3.13: Starch, glycogen, and cellulose are the three main polysaccharides of importance for our field. Obtained from https://www.sedelco.org/cms/lib/PA01001902/Centricity/Domain/506/05_Lecture_Presentation.pdf All three molecules are polymers of α- and β D-glucoses. Starch is a polymer of α-D-glucoses linked together by carbons 1 and 4. Glycogen has essentially the same structure, although it has some branches thanks to a bound between carbon 1 and 6 (Figure 3.14). Figure 3.14: Illustration of the 1-4 links between monomers of alpha-D-glucose for starch, plus 1-6 links to form branches for glycogen, and 1-4 links between monomers of beta-D-glucose for cellulose. Obtained from https://biochemikages005.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/carbohydrates/ Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on earth. Thanks to the hydrogen bonds between adjacent β-D-glucose polymers, very strong cellulose microfibrils form, themselves bundled into macrofibrils. Cellulose molecules can be hydrolyzed thanks to the cellulase enzyme, generally secreted by bacteria, although animals such as termites do produce a cellulase. Most mammals only have a limited ability to digest cellulose fibers, and even ruminants and monogastric herbivores use symbiotic bacteria to produce cellulase. 3.2.4 Other carbohydrates This chapter is still under construction References "],

The transfer of energy and electrons can be summarized in respiration schemes illustrating the electron donors, acceptors, and the byproducts of oxidation and reduction. Us humans have the freedom to go about as we wish. All we need is to eat, drink, breath, and eliminate what we do not need. We could take our automobile cars as another example of bodies able to move about as long as they are fed some fuel. A lot of energy is realized from combustion of fuel or wood. In fact, provided that this energy be funneled into some very smart mechanical systems (e.g., combustion engines), and the energy power delivered is largely superior to any power any human could output. However, the energy consumed is also phenomenal and much of it is lost through heat. Life has found a way to be a lot more parsimonious with energy spending, which makes living organisms to be a lot more energy efficient than combustion in the long run: the respiration process. But in both the cases of combustion or of respiration, energy is liberated or transferred to ATP, respectively, when electrons are transferred from an electron donor to an electron acceptor. Not surprisingly, life and its diversity as we know it, has been able to develop on our planet because primary producers have been able to transfer and store solar energy into a chemical energy, where electrons are effectively stored onto organic molecules, and, because dioxygen O2, the most powerful electron acceptor, is freely floating in our atmosphere. But, then if we ourselves are nothing but a lot of organic matter, therefore a very large source of electrons, and if we leave in an oxygenated environment, how come we are not going into combustion? Obviously this applies to all living organisms. Some of you might think that it is because of the water. But then why would not a very dry piece of paper, or leaves, not automatically catch on fire? The answer lays in two words: activation energy. Electrons do not readily transfer from an electron donor to an electron acceptor because of the activation energy barrier which must be overcome. Activation energy is the level of energy necessary to be overcome for a reaction to carry on. On the Figure below borrowed from Wikipedia, the energy difference between the peaks and the final energy level corresponds to the activation energy Ea Figure 4.1: Activation Energy (Ea) needed for a reaction to proceed. (Ea) can be lowered thanks to a catalyst, and in the case of the respiration chain of living organisms, many of them. Figure borrowed from Wikipedia, Copyrighted free use, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=779552 In normal conditions, this energy is preventing a reaction to proceed. This is why wood or most organic matter do not go into combustion or decomposition on their own. Nitroglycerin is notoriously unstable and the activation energy for electrons to be transferred to O2 is very small, hence its propensity to explode and its danger. However, the activation energy can be overcome with enough heat brought near an electron donor in the form of a flame or a spark. Not much heat is necessary for natural gas (CH4) for combustion to take place, i.e., for transfer of electrons from the carbon to oxygen, releasing three times the volume of gases: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_4 + 2 O_2 \\Rightarrow CO_2 + 2 H_2O \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] hence the explosive nature of this reaction when a concentrated amount of methane is oxidized at once. Overall, it is possible to summarize in an electron tranfer flow scheme (Figure 4.2) the transfer of electrons from methane, i.e., the electron donor, to dioxygen, i.e., the electron acceptor, the byproduct of carbon losing its electrons is CO2 and that of oxygen gaining electrons is H2O (and CO2 as well) Figure 4.2: Summry of the transfer of electrons during oxidative combustion of methane, illustrating the electron donor, acceptor, the byproducts, and the energy released 4.2 Generating energy without combustion Now because none of us and all the living organisms with us, burn to generate energy, there must be other systems to manage to liberate energy, and, there must be ways to have much lower activation energy. Life has found several mechanisms to optimize the transfer of energy from organic matter to a magic molecule: ATP or Adenosine TriPhosphate. 4.3 ATP or the energy currency of the cell There are many ways of transferring energy. To heat a house in the western world, we most often have a centralized heating (and sometimes cooling) system, where the heat is generated, e.g., in a furnace, and then transferred to the rest of the house via pipes and the like. The equivalent system might be for mammals the blood that gets re-oxygenated with the lungs, before it delivers oxygen throughout the body. At the cellular level, however, ATP or Adenosine TriPhosphate is created throughout the cell near the equivalent of the little furnaces: mitochondria. Needless to say, there is no combustion with the mitochondria, and yet there is transfer of electrons and energy delivered. The energy is transferred from the organic matter to ATP, and ATP being a relatively small molecule, can easily reach all metabolic processes, usually operated by proteins, which need energy to proceed (to overcome the activation energy mentioned above). Figure 4.3: ATP molecular structure containing adenosine (= adenine + ribose) and the three phosphate linked together with a pyrophosphate energy rich bond. Copyrighht Pearson Benjamin Cummings The key to storing energy is in the bond between the phosphate, which are often referred to as high-energy bonds. High-energy phosphate bonds are pyrophosphate bonds, acid anhydride linkages formed by taking phosphoric acid derivatives and dehydrating them. As a consequence, the hydrolysis of these bonds is exergonic under physiological conditions, releasing energy. As ATP releases its energy by the break of the pyrophosphate bond, ATP thus becomes ADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) and releases a phosphate in the meantime, like in Figure 4.4. A common representation of this reaction is \\(ATP \\Rightarrow ADP + P_i\\) with the Pi referring to as a phosphate. Figure 4.4: Release of energy ATP hydrolyzed into ADP. http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/atp.html Now that we have allocated electrons on atoms and molecules, you easily understand that the number of electrons on the outside of the triplet \\(PO_3-O-PO_2-O-PO_2\\) is huge. In his fantastic book, Degens (1989) suggests that because of the plethora of electrons on the triphosphate part of ATP, because the tetrahedral phosphate molecules are linked together by one of the corners of each tetrahedron (Figure 4.5), and because of the \\(\\pi\\) electron bonds (double bond) which tends to repulse each other (Degens 1989), the triphosphate molecule can only be in constant movement, which ‘maintains the animated world’ (Degens 1989). Figure 4.5: Tetrahedral configuration of each of the phosphate molecule which when linked together supposedly are in constant movement 4.4 The ATP manufacture If ATP freely releases energy for a reaction to proceed in the cell, as ATP becomes ADP + Pi, there must be energy at one point to ‘manufacture’ or recharge the ATP molecule in the first place. We have seen that much of the energy in the cell is transferred thanks to the ATP molecule. So could we just make ATP from the energy liberated by ATP??? The answer is no, obviously… The energy to create ATP has to come from elsewhere, otherwise it just cannot work…!!! Life has found a wonderful way to do that thanks to proton flows. Yes, that is correct, a proton flow. ATP is literally formed from an ADP and a phosphate and assembled thanks to a protein called ATP synthase, or ATPase, which seems to be activated or powered almost mechanically, very much like a water mill, by a proton flow (Figure 4.6). The force to turn the ATPase is refered to as the Proton Motive Force. Figure 4.6: Artist representation of the ATP synthase powered, almost mechanically by proton flows. By The original uploader was Asw-hamburg at German Wikipedia - Transferred from de.wikipedia to Commons by Leyo using CommonsHelper., CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8993938 The ‘head’ of the ATPase, which looks a bit like a ‘mushroom hat’, referred to as the FO region, rotates as a result of the proton flow and allows the phosphorylation of ADP. It is thus fair to call the ATPase a ‘proton mill’. You may want to look at this very nice concise document on ATP synthase on Wikipedia, which provides more detailed information. Figure 4.7 shows very nicely how the mechanical force of the H+ flow is thought to allow Pi to be attached to an ADP. Figure 4.7: ATP synthase in action. Obtained with permission from HarvardX In summary, this mechanical force is what generates the synthesis of ATP from ADP, or phosphorylation. So this solves that part of the ATP synthesis. Now, another mechanism must be responsible for the formation of the proton flow. 4.5 Creating a proton gradient as a source of proton flow Until now, I have not even mentioned where all this takes place. We are about to see where this happens. But first, let us take an analogy to better understand the proton flow responsible for the synthesis of ATP. Flow of matter just does not happen on its own, it only happens as a result of a gradient between a compartment and another. Using the water mill analogy, the reason why there is release of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the water is because there is a drop in elevation, and therefore in potential energy between the ‘compartments’ upstream and downstream the mill. To increase the hydraulic gradient, men throughout the world have built dams to create compartments and increase the hydraulic gradient between upstream and downstream the mill. So in the water mill analogy, the hydraulic gradient is maintained thanks to the dam which creates compartments, and to the continuous arrival of new water upstream and to the leaving of water downstream. So three things are necessary for the release of kinetic energy (which in the end is going to power the rotation of a mill wheel, and in the old days would grind wheat or corn grain): a system to compartmentalize water, a supply of water, and, an outlet for the water so that is does not accumulate. By analogy, the formation of ATP corresponds to the grain grinding; the proton flow corresponds to the water flowing that activates the mill wheel, and in our case the proton flow activates the ATPase. We now need to address the three parts of the system needed to have a proton gradient and flow: a compartment system, a proton supply system, and, a system to use protons so the gradient is maintained. 4.5.1 A compartment to accumulate protons We saw earlier that the double phospholipid layer made the cell membrane. Well if you close a membrane on itself you will make a compartment or a balloon. It turns out that if you look at a typical prokaryotic cell and at organelles in a eukaryotic cell (Figure 4.8), there are compartments formed between a cell wall and the plasma membrane for prokaryotic cells, and between two double layer phospholipid membranes for the eukaryotic cells. So in reality, it is a bit as if one were to create a space between two balloons. Figure 4.8: Artist representation of a prokaryotic cell and a mitochondrion from a eukaryotic showing the intermembrane spaces: between the cell wall and plasma membrane for the prokaryotic cell, and, between the outer and inner membranes for the mitochondrion. https://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/animals/animalmodel.html and By Kelvinsong - Own work, CC0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=27715320 At the end though, there exists for prokaryotic cells and mitochondria (and most organelles for eukaryotic cell) an inter-membrane space, which effectively creates compartments to accumulate ‘things’. The double phospholipid membrane is so strong and so tight that it is proton-tight. In other words, if somehow protons accumulate in this inter-membrane space, protons cannot leave through the membrane, they can only leave through designated areas. And yes, you guessed right, the designated area for protons to leave the inter-membrane space is the ATP synthase! So to take another analogy, you can imagine an inner tube full of air under pressure, air can only leave through the valve. And if you were to put a little fan in front of the valve as you are releasing air, the fan would rotate. Imagine that this is essentially what happens: the ATPase is both the valve and the fan as it literally rotates with the proton flow. 4.5.2 A supply of protons for the intermembrane space: proton pumps Now, the next natural question is that in the case of an inner tube, somebody pumped some air into the tube to put it under pressure. Similarly, there must be a system that pumps protons into the inter-membrane space. And yes indeed, you guessed it right, there are proton pumps that do the job. But again, these pumps must be powered by some sort of energy. Let us pause for a second. We have seen in section 4.1 that generally speaking, energy is generated from the transfer of electrons. But until now, we have not even mentioned electrons: only ATP and protons…? This is where electrons come in: energetic electrons transported onto electron transfer molecules are the ones that power the proton pumps! It is time to take a bird’s eye view again. Energy liberation exists when electrons are transferred from an electron donor to an electron acceptor. Life has found a way to capture this energy in the form of ATP, which allows transportation of energy to the needed places in the cell. So the energy transfer in the cell does not have to be totally instantaneous like combustion would be, and it can be spent exactly where it needs to be spent. Yet, the production of ATP is in fact generated by an electron transfer, but indirectly. No, electrons are NOT transferred from organic matter to ATP. Yes, electrons are ultimately transferred from organic matter to an electron acceptor, which in the case of aerobic respiration is O2. But just like the generation of ATP is indirectly linked to the electron transfer, the transfer of electrons from organic matter to the ultimate electron acceptor is also indirect. A set of molecules called electron transfer molecules are intermediate carrier of electrons and are the ones which power the proton pumps as represented in Figure 4.9 below. Figure 4.9: Artist representation of the ATP synthesis powered by a proton flow, itself powered by a proton gradient, itself produced thanks to proton pumps powered by energy rich electrons carried by electron transfer molecules. Obtained from 2006 Pearson Education 4.5.3 Electron transfer molecules that power the proton pumps The two main electron transfer molecules in the respiration process are called NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide; Figure 4.10) and FAD (flavine adenine dinucleotide; Figure 4.11). These two nucleotides have the ability to be reduced (= gain electrons) and oxidized (= lose electrons), and because they are mobile, to carry electrons from the cell (bacteria) or mitochondrion (eukaryot) cytoplasm to the proton pumps. Figure 4.10: Molecular formula of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) in both oxydized and reduced states Figure 4.11: Molecular formula of Flavine Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) in both oxydized and reduced states 4.6 Transfer of electrons from the Organic Carbon to an electron acceptor So this answers the question of how the proton pumps are powered, but it is now time to look at the global fate of electrons: where do they come from and where do they end up? Actually, we already know the global answers to these questions: the electrons are stored unto the C, N, and S of organic molecules and they are eventually accepted by an electron acceptor; in the case of aerobic respiration, O2 is the ultimate electron acceptor. Before there might be any confusion, in the aerobic respiration process that involves organic molecules as electron donors (we will see that inorganic molecules can also be electron donors), strangely enough, the only atom which donates electron is carbon while the nitrogen and sulfur atoms keep all their eight electrons. Specialized microbes, called lithotrophs, literally ‘feed on stone’, which means that their source of electron is from an inorganic molecule, have the ability to use ammonium and hydrogen sulfide as electron donor (8 electrons available for ‘donation’) in their aerobic respiration chains. So all this to say that in aerobic respiration that involves organic matter, only the carbon atom donates its electrons. The organisms which use organic matter as electron donors are called organotrophs. We, as mammals and humans, are organotrophs. 4.6.1 Oxygen reduction Let us start from the end of the process: the reduction of oxygen into H2O, as represented on Figure 4.9 above. As the NAD and FAD are powering proton pumps (which names include FMN, ubiquinone, cytochrome a, b, and c see Figure 4.9), the electrons lose some of their energy and migrate within the phospholipid membrane from the proton pumps towards the ATPase. Because of the involvement of many different proteins involved in this transport, this is referred to as the electron transfer chain. Because the NAD and the FAD molecules are oxidized (they have given up their electrons), and because at the ATPase location, ADP gains a phosphate to become ATP, the whole process is referred to as oxidative phosphorylation. At the confluence between the ATPase and the cytochrome a3, the reaction (4.2) occurs: \\[\\begin{equation} O_2 + 4 e^- + 4 H^+ \\Rightarrow 2 H_2O \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] This is the place where the electrons are accepted!!! So now you know exactly where all this is happening! Is not that wonderful? So the electrons are accepted by O2 (remember on a molecule of O2, each Oxygen atom only has 6 electrons for itself, so each can accept two more), and these electrons reduce oxygen into H2O. This has several consequences: the reduction of O2 also consumes 4 H+, which solves the necessity for an outlet for protons as they flow out of the inter-membrane through the ATPase, which was the third condition to maintain a proton gradient the reduction of O2 obviously consumes electrons, which also provides an outlet for the electrons. In order words, if no electron acceptors are available, then the electrons at the proton pumps have no outlet, so the proton pumps are stalled, which in turn halts the maintaining of a proton gradient, which eventually stops the production of ATP. 4.6.2 Electron fate from organic matter to electron transfer molecules The fate of electrons from organic matter or glucose to the electron transfer molecules involves two processes called glycolysis and the Krebs or citric acid cycle. Biology majors have to learn in details all the steps and the name of the molecules involved in these chain reactions. This is beside our point for our class. Instead I want you to understand and know that these reactions involve transfer of electrons from organic carbon onto electron transfer molecules the release of carbon atoms which have lost all their electrons, therefore releasing C in the form of CO2. the hydrolysis of glucose molecules to pyruvate, a C3 molecule (a 3 carbon organic molecule) during the glycolysis, which then loses CO2 as it enters the citric cycle the acetyl-coA, a co-enzyme is key to incorporate organic carbon in the Krebs cycle. In Figure 4.12 below which summarizes all the aerobic respiration pathways, you can see that most of the ATP is formed thanks to the proton flow, and that electron transfer molecules are involved in all steps. Figure 4.12: Summary of cellular respiration with the ATP and electron transfer budget. Obtained from https://cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/847806852426104839/1240/10/scaletowidth This 4.12 diagram does not show where the CO2 are produced so I invite to see, in addition to the notes given in class, that CO2 is released as pyruvic acid enters in the Figures 4.14 and 4.13 below. Figure 4.13: Glycolysis pathway. Image Figure 4.14: Krebs or citric acid cycle pathway. 4.7 Summary of respiration We have purposely presented the molecular processes of respiration starting from the end and moving back to the beginning of the respiration chain. We can summarize the respiration process again in that order: the goal of respiration is to transfer energy initially stored as high energy electrons on organic molecules to ATP, the energy currency of the cell The production of ATP itself has to come from a different source of energy than that liberated by ATP itself ATP is synthesized by the phosphorylation of ADP by the ATP synthase, itself powered by a proton flow from the inter-membrane space to the cytoplasm space the proton flow is powered by a proton gradient between the inter-membrane space and the cytoplasm space This gradient is made possible thanks to a proton-tight compartment corresponding to the inter-membrane space a supply of protons from the cytoplasm to the inter-membrane space, fed by proton pumps an outlet for the protons flowing out and powering the ATPase (‘the proton mill’), which combined with the reduction of oxygen form water molecules The proton pumps are themselves powered by the oxidation of electron transfer molecules (NAD and FAD), which carry high energy electrons from the Krebs or citric cycle to the electron transfer chain The electron transfer molecules accept the electrons, or are reduced during glycolysis, before and during the Krebs cycle as organic carbon are oxidized or lose their electrons and release CO2. The other way to present respiration is to say that: Energy rich electrons stored on organic molecules are transferred onto electron transfer molecules during glycolysis, before and during the Krebs cycle The high energy electrons thus transported power proton pumps placed in the inner membrane of the cell for unicellular organisms or of the mitochodrion for eukaryotic cells These pumps feed a supply of protons to the inter-membrane space which, because this space is proton-tight, and because protons outlets are limited to the ATP synthase, creates an accumulation of protons in this space The accumulation of protons creates a proton gradient between the inter-membrane space and the cytoplasm, which generates a proton flow at designated ‘holes’ in the membrane The protons flow out the inter-membrane through the ATP synthase which can be approximated by proton canals and almost mechanically turn the ATPase head which acts as a ‘proton mill’ This proton mill catalyzes the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP The proton gradient is maintained possible because the protons flowing out of the inter-membrane space are combined with electrons reducing oxygen into water The electron flow is maintained thanks to the same oxygen reduction, which in turns allows electron transfer molecules to be oxidized so that then can take their ‘proton load’ again. Overall respiration consists in transferring high energy electrons from organic molecules to oxygen, and by doing so creating a proton gradient which in turn is the main driver for the formation of ATP in the cell. Both summaries present the same story but have their own logic. Other important subtleties of respiration include: In the case organic molecules are the source of electrons, only the carbon atom donates electrons, the amine and thiol radicals being eliminated as a by-product DO NOT donate their electrons in this respiration system. This is admittedly a bit weird as the the amine and thiol groups still have 8 electrons to donate each. 4.8 Respiration electron flow schemes 4.8.1 Linkages between respiration and microbial processes These few paragraphs and pages were necessary but we now need to connect them with some of the practical consequences that concern ecological engineering. The electron donors are the fuel for all microbial processes involved in the substrate of ‘treatment systems’. The byproduct of the loss of electrons originally stored on the electron donor will be a source of inorganic molecules that matter When the electron acceptor is O2, this results in an oxygen demand which may have consequences on the overall oxygen level and may lead to anaerobic conditions, where other electron acceptors come in play We try to take advantage of the anaerobic conditions to dissipate or strip excess nutrients, e.g. NO3- 4.8.2 Respiration schemes So we thought we could provide a nice concise summary of respiration to highlight the points that matter for environmental and microbial considerations in the form of respiration schemes, still maintaining some of the important drivers of the formation of ATP. In the first respiration scheme in Figure 4.15 below, the transfer of electrons is represented by the blue wavy line. Electrons are transferred from an electron donor to an electron acceptor. The consequences of the transfer are represented in thicker light blue arrows. The first consequence of the transfer of electrons is the powering of proton pumps, which in turn create a proton gradient in the inter-membrane space, which result into proton flow, which gives the necessary energy to catalyze the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP. The products of oxidation, reduction, and phosphorylation are represented in black arrows. Figure 4.15: Generic respiration scheme illustrating the flow of electrons from an electron donor to and electron acceptor, the by-products of the respective oxidation and reduction, and the consequences on proton gradients and flow, which ultimately help catalyse the formation of ATP The respiration scheme is obviously an oversimplified representation of the what happens as described above, but generally holds true. Some ATP are generated during glycolysis and in association with the Krebs cycle, but represent 4 out of a total of 38, or about 10% of the total. So it is probably fair to simplify things to represent the majority of the processes (here 90%). The beauty of this scheme is that it applies to just about all types of electron donors and acceptors. 4.8.3 Aerobic respiration schemes for organotrophs In the next scheme, we take the classic example of aerobic respiration, where glucose is considered as the electron donor, and O2 the electron acceptor. Figure 4.16: Aerobic respiration scheme illustrating the flow of electrons from glucose to O2, the by-products of the respective oxidation and reduction being CO2 and H2O, and H2O. The consequences of the transfer of electrons on proton pumps, gradients and flow, which ultimately help catalyse the formation of ATP, do not change from the generic respiration scheme above Using the generic carbohydrate CH2O as a source of electrons, it is possible to express the donation of electrons in equation (4.3) (redox half reaction): \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + H_2O \\rightarrow CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\tag{4.3} \\end{equation}\\] Organisms which use organic molecules as electron donors are referred to as organotrophs, hence the title. We shall see later that some microorganisms are able to use inorganic molecules as their electron donors. In our case (Figure 4.16), the byproduct of glucose as the carbon atoms lose all their electrons becomes CO2 as show in equation (4.3). In turn, the electrons are accepted by O2 following equation (4.4) \\[\\begin{equation} O_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightarrow 4H_2O \\tag{4.4} \\end{equation}\\] The combination of donating electrons from glucose (equation (4.3)), or organic matter illustrated in Figure 4.17, combined with the accepting of these electrons by O2 (equation (4.4)), results in the combined overall summary of aerobic respiration: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + O_2 \\rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \\tag{4.5} \\end{equation}\\] The third scheme (Figure 4.17), the generic term organic matter is used to show that in reality, not only glucose can be part of the electron transfer chain, but essentially all types of organic molecules, as represented in Figure 4.18. So the only difference with the previous scheme with glucose only, are the by-products of the catabolism of organic matter: CO2, NH4+, HS-, and PO43-. Figure 4.17: Aerobic respiration scheme illustrating the flow of electrons from organic matter to O2, the by-products of the oxidation of OM include ammonium, hydrogen sulfide and phosphate this time The important thing to notice here is that the N and S atoms, which in organic molecules possess 8 electrons for themselves, or are fully reduced, stay reduced as byproducts of respiration. This might appear odd as mentioned before, because there are electrons available for another oxidation to take place. Lithotroph micro-organisms are specialized in taking advantage of these available electrons, as we shall see later. The important message here is that you can see that respiration processes essentially breakdown large molecules into small inorganic ones, and that in the case of respiration for organotrophs, the only atom to lose its electrons is carbon. Figure 4.18: Oxidative phosphorylation of organic molecules of carbohydrates but of other molecular families as well. Figure obtained from Essential Cell Biology from Garland Science If we think about this apparent oddity, N and S are a lot more electronegative than C, so in the organotroph cell, it is a lot easier for oxygen to strip electrons from carbon than it is from N and S. It might be worth taking a hydraulic analogy: in a soil, pore water will tend to drain through the area of a soil that has the highest hydraulic conductivity, or use the path of least resistance, totally by-passing areas of lower hydraulic conductivity. Chemically, it is just a lot easier to obtain electrons and energy out of the reduced carbon, and a lot harder to obtain them from amine (-NH2) and thiol (-SH) radicals; this is why N and S stay in a reduced form as byproducts of organotrophic respiration. Again, several group of lithotrophs specifically target the electrons on ammonium and on Hydrogen sulfide, and use O2 as their electron acceptor. In the next chapter, we will introduce all the respiration processes, aerobic and anaerobic, and performed by organotrophs and lithotrophs. References "],

The secret is that in an aerobic environment with the atoms of oxygen in the dioxygen molecule being so eager to capture electrons, the electrons can freely and will naturally flow from the organic molecules to oxygen. This electron transfer releases energy. We have seen that in the case of methane combustion, the electron transfer is direct, leading to the release of ephemeral heat and light, resulting in a large and sudden increase of entropy. But this type of energy release is just not sustainable for organisms which must find ways to minimize the energy release in the form of heat, and have a way to release the energy exactly where it is needed. It does need an intermediate and ubiquitous storage of energy. The secret is the pyrophosphate bond of the ATP molecule, which can temporarily store lots of energy without the involvment of direct electron transfer. The formation of the pyrophosphate bonds is thought to be mechanically induced by the rotation of the ATPase, itself powered by a proton flow maintained between compartments. In the end the electron transfer only indirectly leads to the formation of ATP, by powering the proton pumps. It is thus fascinating that the release of the energy chemically stored onto high energy electrons on organic molecules involves many small steps, which essentially prevent the direct transfer from the electron donor to the acceptor, which would lead to combustion… All of this works in the long run if somehow there is a source of organic molecules, otherwise with a finite amount of organic molecules, the respiration process would eventually deplete all organic molecules on earth. So the correlary to the energy release in respiration, is the capture and storage of energy. And this is where it is very useful to be on a planet close enough to its star such that receives enough but not too much energy. One of life’s secret has been to be able to capture this allochthonous source of energy, i.e., sunlight, and store it, and now you know in what form: store it in the form of high energy electrons onto organic molecules. This chapter provides enough of the details of photosynthesis processes that lead to the formation of carbohydrates. 5.1 Requirements to store energy on organic molecules 5.2 No need to reinvent the wheel for the production of ATP and the transfer of electrons Chapter still under construction "],

We took aerobic respiration as our model to determine that most of the ATP produced in the cell is principally due to a proton flow from the inter-membrane space to the cytoplasm, for microbial cells and within the mitochondria for eukaryotic cells (Figure 4.12). The respiration schemes provide a very handy method to summarize the important drivers and consequences of respiration: the electron donors, the electron acceptors, and the byproducts of both oxidation and reduction. In this chapter we are going to explore the diversity of electron donors and acceptors present in nature, many of which represent important processes for ecological engineering. As a first step, we will use a theoretical wetland soil to explore some of the variety of respiration schemes. We will take advantage of these processes at play in wetland soils to explore the consequences on concentration gradients and movement of molecules of importance in environmental and ecological engineering. We will then introduce additional ways microbes have found to obtain their energy, and summarize the whole using the different prefixes for the word ‘trophs’. 6.1 The theoretical vertical sequence of respiratory processes in wetland soils For this we will use a theoretical wetland soil to illustrate our point. Such theoretical soil has ‘enough’ organic matter content for microbial respiration to take place throughout its profile, ‘enough’ of other sand, silt, and clay and all the minerals that accompany them, including iron and manganese oxides. Let us assume that this theoretical soil, is sufficiently moist and aerated for microbial aerobic respiration to take place throughout the soil profile. Let us then assume that this soil is suddenly flooded, and let us explore the consequences of this. Respiratory processes are going to occur on a temporal sequence, which in fact will be mirrored by a vertical sequence of processes in the wetland sediment. 6.2 An aerobic layer near the soil-water interface At first, all micro-organisms are going to use all the oxygen that might be present in the pore space. But because pore space is now getting filled with water, it is possible that the amount of oxygen available for microorganisms might change. And yes, indeed, water does not have nearly the capacity to provide oxygen as air does for several reasons: at 15°C in water there are about 10 mg of O2 in one liter of water. Comparatively, in one liter of air, there is about 300 mg of O2, or 30 times more. How does one calculate this? At standard conditions, 1 liter of air at 21% oxygen possesses 0.21 L of oxygen. Since for these conditions, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L, simply divide 0.21/22.4, to arrive at 0.0094 moles of oxygen. Then the mass of oxygen in 1 liter of air is 0.0094×32 g/mole = 300 mg. the diffusivity (which quantifies the ability of elements to move about) of O2 in air is 0.176 cm²/s while that of O2 in water is 2.10×10−5 cm²/s, or more than 8,000 times smaller (Wikipedia contributors 2017) In other words, it is good to remember that the amount of oxygen available in water compared to air is about 30 less, and that oxygen in water moves more than 8,000 slower in water than in air. So, one can clearly see that the potential supply of oxygen from flooded porewater is thus a lot more limited than in aerated pore space. Now, where is the potential source for supply of oxygen for our recently flooded soil? The answer is the atmosphere. For a real flooded wetland soil, another source of O2 might be photosynthesis from algae and aquatic vegetation during the day. But in all cases, most of the oxygen needed for microbial aerobic respiration of our new flooded soil will have to travel the distance corresponding to the thickness of the water column, and, the linear distance within the porous medium of the soil, which can be quite tortuous. This property of the soil/sediment has been factored in by researchers and been called tortuosity. In summary, the supply of oxygen to bacteria in a flooded soil is limited because of four factors: there is about 30 times less O2 in water than there is in the same volume of air the O2 diffusive transport capacity in water is about 8,000 times smaller than that in air O2 has to travel from the atmosphere to the soil through the thickness of the water column, and travel through the tortuous path of the soil porous medium In addition to these four rules, which apply to all aquatic systems, the velocity of water matters very much in the reaeration process, which corresponds to factor 1 above: reaeration is much higher for streams than for stagnant waters (see this chapter). In other words, the stagnant water above our flooded wetland soil example, is another factor, compared to streams, which further limits the supply of oxygen to the aerobic bacteria in the flooded soil. This will be developed at length in the thermochemistry part of the class. Not surprisingly, this supply is just too limited compared to the demand. As a result, most of our recently flooded soil bacteria consumes all the O2 and the only part of the sediment that might have a little bit of oxygen is the area at the soil-water interface. This is what it illustrated in Figure 6.1 below. Figure 6.1: Animation summarizing the formation of aerobic and anaerobic layers of a theoretical flooded wetland soil due to the imbalance between bacterial respiratory oxygen demand and oxygen supply through the water column Because the O2 demand exceeds the O2 supply from the atmosphere and the water column, an O2 concentration gradient forms from the soil-water interface down. This concentration gradient, in turn, drives a downward movement of oxygen from the water column into the sediment down to the depth where there is no more concentration gradient. This depth defines the beginning of the anaerobic zone of the sediment, and above, the aerobic layer of the sediment. 6.3 Respiration in the anaerobic zone of the soil What happens to all the microbes in the anaerobic zone of the sediment? Certainly the exclusively aerobic microbes just do not survive, but most bacteria are facultative aerobs. In other words, they can switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration. Let us state this again: in the anaerobic zone of the sediment, only unicellular microorganisms are able to survive and have had to adapt their respiration to still be able to produce ATP for their metabolism, but using electron acceptors other than O2. It turns out that thermodynamics dictate that not all electron acceptors can generate the same amount of energy when they strip electrons from their electron donors. As a result, one can classify electron acceptors in decreasing order from the most to the least oxidizing, and the list of preferred electron acceptors goes as such: nitrate or NO3- Manganese oxide (MnO2) or Mn IV Iron oxides/hydroxyde or Fe III sulfate or SO42- Carbon dioxide or CO2 Although very different microbes are involved at the different stages, the apparent demand for electron acceptor, in our theoretical wetland soil, can be described as a temporal sequence of events: oxygen is the preferred electron acceptor; when O2 is all used, NO3- will be used as the preferred electron acceptor; when all the NO3- is used, the next most powerful electron acceptor is MnO2 (also referred to Mn IV; IV corresponds to its oxidation state), which is present in a solid or mineral form in soils; when all the MnO2 is used, then iron oxide or hydroxyde, which are also in the solid phase (also referred to Fe III, III corresponds to its oxidation state) will be used as the preferred electron acceptor; when all the Fe is used, then SO42- is used as the next preferred electron acceptor, and then when finally all the other electron acceptors have been all used, CO2 can be the ultimate electron acceptor…! Finally, to this temporal sequence corresponds a theoretical spatial sequence or layers where each of the electron acceptor essentially defines a soil layer, with the layers organized with depth from the most to the least oxidizing electron acceptor as represented in Figure 6.2 Figure 6.2: Theoretical spatial layering of wetland soils corresponding to the electron acceptor available, not too long after flooding. In each layer, the oxidizing and the reduced forms are illustrated as oxidizing/reduced. Not to scale It is now time to present the respiration processes in each of the redox layer. 6.4 A denitrification layer below the aerobic layer The next most powerful or oxidizing electron acceptor after O2 is NO3-. We have seen in the previous chapters that the N atom in nitrate has zero electron for itself, hence its ability to accept electrons. Just like for aerobic respiration, nitrate reduction just does not happen on its own. Facultative anaerobic bacteria called denitrifiers take advantage of the electrons available on organic matter and of nitrate to accept them to generate their energy. The denitrification of this theoretical wetland soil is referred to as heterotrophic denitrification because the source of carbon for these denitrifiers is also the source of electron, as OM is the source of both. The autolithotrophic denitrifiers, which use pyrite FeS2 as their source of electrons, are presented later in this chapter. There are two possible byproducts of nitrate reduction: N2, which is the inert gas that makes 78% of our atmosphere, and N2O, which is a potent greenhouse gas. The byproduct of the oxidation of OM are the same as the ones in aerobic heterotrophic respiration, i.e., CO2, NH4+, HS-, and PO43-. Figure 6.3: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic denitrification In reality, denitrification involves not a direct reduction of nitrate into N2 or N2O, but rather a sequence of reductions, summarized in equation (6.1), where nitrite, nitrogen monoxide, and nitrous oxides are intermediate products: \\[\\begin{equation} NO_3^- \\rightarrow NO_2^- \\rightarrow NO \\rightarrow N_2O \\rightarrow N_2 \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] Nitrous oxide is thus evidence of an incomplete denitrification. Because denitrification currently is the one mechanism, which removes nitrogen from the aqueous phase as gaseous byproduct, it currently ranks as the most effective ways to treat excess nitrogen in water. Entire research programs are dedicated to the development of methods and treatment systems to optimize this process. One of the active research areas is about finding ways to have denitrification go all the way to the N2 stage to minimize the production of N2O. Because this is a reduction process, and because nitrate is not assimilated in the denitrifier cells, a very short and good definition of denitrification is the microbially mediated dissimilatory reduction of nitrate into dinitrogen. The nitrogen atoms in the N2 molecule have 5 electrons for themselves. For complete denitrification, this means that the nitrogen atom has gained 5 electrons from NO3- to N~2. We will see in this chapter that it is possible to numerically show this in what is referred to as redox half reactions. A more complete and more descriptive definition of denitrification is Denitrification refers to the dissimilatory reduction, by essentially aerobic bacteria, of one or both of the ionic nitrogen oxides (nitrate, NO3-, and nitrite, NO2-) to the gaseous oxides (nitric oxide, NO, and nitrous oxide, N20), which may themselves be further reduced to dinitrogen (N2). The nitrogen oxides act as terminal electron acceptors in the absence of oxygen. The gaseous nitrogen species are major products of these reductive processes (Knowles 1982). The details of the electron transfer near the denitrifiers inner membrane are actually different (Figure 6.4) than those of aerobic respiration as illustrated in Figure 4.9 in this chapter. More proteins are involved, which descriptions are provided in Figure 6.4. The details of the denitrification of the electron transfer chain are beyond the purpose of this book. However, it is important to recognize that the electrons, originally stored on organic molecules, are brought to the membrane on the cytoplasm side by the electron transfer molecule NADH, just as is the case for aerobic respiration. It is also important to see that protons are pumped from the cytoplasm to the periplasm by ‘proton pumps’ such as cytochromes, and nitrate reductase powered by ubiquinone. Although the ATPase is not illustrated in Figure 6.4, the proton gradient formed in the periplasm does generate the proton motive force for the synthesis of ATP. In the end the electron transfer scheme of denitrication illustrated in Figure 6.3 holds, and sufficies for our purpose. Figure 6.4: Summary of Electron Transfer Chain for heterotrophic denitrification (after Su et al. (2015)). NAR: Nitrate reductase; NIR: nitrite reductase; NOR: nitric oxide reductace; N2OR: nitrous oxide reductase; UQ: ubiquinol; Fe-S: iron-sulfur protein; Cyt b, Cyt c: cytochrome b and c Denitrification is thought to be inhibited by the presence of oxygen, and thus only occurs in our theoretical wetland soil, below the aerobic layer. However, denitrification only occurs if there is nitrate present as electron acceptor. Therefore, for denitrification to proceed, there must be a supply of nitrate that can compensate the demand due to denitrification. The only place from where nitrate can be supplied, is the water column, and, possibly, the aerobic layer of the sediment where nitrification can take place, as we shall see later. Following the same analysis as that of aerobic respiration, the demand for nitrate creates a downward flux of nitrate from the water column down. Because of the transport distance for nitrate from the water column and through the aerobic layer of the sediment, the supply tends to be lower than the demand. This suggests that at one point in depth there will be no more nitrate as they are consumed faster than they can diffuse downward. Nitrates thus diffuse through layer 1, and both diffuse and are consumed as electron acceptors in layer 2 in Figure 6.2. Again, because the demand exceeds the supply, nitrates cannot move further down than the bottom of layer 2. Denitrification is thus theoretically restricted to layer 2. 6.5 Manganese and Iron oxides reductions Below the denitrification layer, microbes have to find new electron acceptors for their respiration. After O2, which is a gas, NO3-, which is a dissolved anion, the next elements which serve as electron acceptors are solids: Manganese and Iron oxides. They will serve as electron acceptors, only if soil minerals containing Mn and Fe oxides are present. In our theoretical wetland soil, the assumption is that these oxides are present. In layer 3 (Figure 6.2), MnO2 serve as the electron acceptor. In the MnO2 minerals, the manganese is in the Mn (IV) form, and can accept up to 2 e- to become the mobile Mn2+ cation. The quantitative details of the transfer of electrons are given in in this chapter. Overall the Manganese reduction respiration scheme is illustrated in Figure 6.5. Figure 6.5: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic Manganese oxide reduction While the electron donor is immobile, the reduction of MnO2 produces Mn2+ ions, which are dissolved, mobile in water, and can diffuse following concentration gradients. In our original hypothesis of the sudden flooding of the wetland soil, MnO2 oxides would be reduced from layer 3 down. The Mn2+ ions produced in these layers, and the lack of Mn2+ ions in layers 1 and 2, would create a concentration gradient, which would generate an upward flux of Mn2+, this time, from layers 3 to 6 into layers 2 and 1. The fate of Mn2+ ions as they reach the aerobic layer is discussed below. The global significance of managenese reduction to carbon oxidation in aquatic sediments seems to be rather low (reviewed in Thamdrup 2000), and less than 10% of total benthic mineralization. The contribution of organotrophic Mn reduction is limited by the low Mn content with depletion of Mn oxides within the upper 1-2 cm of most sediments and by slow reaction kenetics relative to the competing inorganic reduction. In contrast to Mn, Fe reduction contributes significantly to carbon oxidation in many sediments (Thamdrup 2000). After the MnO2 oxides are reduced, the iron oxides and hydroxide minerals will similarly serve as electron donors following the general equation (??), and respiration scheme illustrated in Figure 6.6. The reduction of an iron hydroxide Fe(OH)3 has been added to show that in reality, Fe3+ never exists as such, but almost always as iron oxides or hydroxides. Many forms of iron oxides exist in soils, hence the choice of choosing iron hydroxide Fe(OH)3 in equation (??). Fe3+, Fe(OH)3, and other iron oxides are referred to as ferric iron or Fe(III), because their oxidation state is 3. Ferric iron generally has an orange rusty color. As Fe3+ is oxidized into Fe2+, it gains one electron. Figure 6.6: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic Iron oxide reduction The electron transfer chain for manganese has not been researched as much as that of Fe, although the latter still holds many unknowns. Many different proteins are involved, and may vary depending on the organisms. In a recent review, Bird et al. (2011) illustrate two identified pathways. The first one for Geobacter sulfurreducens (Figure 6.7) involves a suite of proteins referred to as Omp or Omc. The energy yield of the electron transfer seems rather low however. The extracellular location of the electron acceptor (Fe III) is energetically costly, particularly because the proton gradient between the periplasm and the cytoplasm is limited by the absence of proton consumption in the cytoplasm (as is the case for aerobic respiration when the electrons are accepted in the cytoplasm with the consumption of a proton along with it). Using any external electron acceptor thus costs the cell one proton per electron transferred. The second reason for low efficiency is that the electron transport chain is short. In the current model of electron transfer to Fe(III), no energy is harvested after the electrons reach the periplasm. The amount of energy extracted from the electron transport chain therefore depends not on the potential difference (DE) between NADH and the final acceptor, but on the DE between NADH and the periplasmic acceptor. […] s. It therefore seems that Geobacter has adapted to use low-potential substrates [e.g. Fe(III) minerals] rather than maintaining an electron transport chain that would allow it to extract greater energy from higher potential acceptors(Figure 6.7; Bird, Bonnefoy, and Newman (2011)). Figure 6.7: (a) Electron tranfer chain for the organotrophic reduction of ferric iron (Fe III).

Abbreviations: NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; cit, citrate.scheme for heterotrophic Iron oxide reduction. from (Bird, Bonnefoy, and Newman 2011) In their second illustration, Bird et al. (2011) show that Shewanella oneidensis does not use proton gradients and the ATPase to produce ATP, but rather uses substrate level phosphorylation to gain energy when reducing Fe(III). The hypothesis is that the oxidation of lactate to acetate is sufficient to produce ATP, and this substrate level phosphorylation can go on at the electron donated to NADH end up on Fe (III) (Figure 6.8). Figure 6.8: (a) Electron tranfer chain for the organotrophic reduction of ferric iron (Fe III) in Shewanella. MtrC and OmcA are thought to be donors to Fe(III). Whether they interact directly with solid Fe(III), chelated Fe(III), electron shuttles such as flavins, or all three is unclear. ATP generation takes place via substrate level phosphorylation. (b) Schematic of reduction potentials of the Shewanella electron transfer pathway. Arrow on scale bar denotes the energetically favorable direction. Blue arrows denote the aerobic path electrons take to O2, red arrows denote the path to Fe(III), and yellow bars denote potential ranges. The potentials of NADH1, bc1, and aa1 are simplified for clarity; in reality, each of these protein complexes has multiple redox centers and a range of potentials.

Similarly to Mn2+ ions, Fe2+ ions, or ferrous iron, or Fe(II) is a dissolved iron which is mobile in water, and can diffuse following concentration gradients. For the same reasons explained above for Mn2+, an upward concentration gradient between zones 4 to 6 and layers 3 to 1 is going to appear and the Fe2+ ions will tend to diffuse upward through layers 3 and 2. The fate of Fe2+ ions as they reach the aerobic layer is discussed below. This vertical spatial sequence of layers 3 and 4 presented here probably only applies not too long after the theoretical wetland soil has been flooded. Indeed, over the long periods, the supply of ferric iron and manganese oxides will run out, as the only supply is in immobile mineral forms. So over long periods, layers 3 and 4 do not exist. Is the case of a net downward water infiltration, the Fe2+ and Mn2+ ions diffuse upward all the way into the aerobic layer, and accumulate there for reasons illustrated below. In the more likely case of small but real net downward flux of water, the dissolved ions will leach out of the soil profile. The consequences are that poorly drained soils then to leach out their iron and manganese, which is referred to as iron and manganese depletion. This is the reason for the grey color of hydric soils (Figure 6.9). Figure 6.9: Example of pale bluish gray redox depletions. Note the faint rusty orange concentration distributed throughout the soil matrix. Reproduced with permission © 2012 Nature Education All rights reserved. 6.6 Sulfate reduction After all previous electron acceptors have been used, sulfate becomes the next electron acceptor. As we have seen before, the sulfur atom on SO42- has zero electrons for itself and it therefore can accept electrons following redox half-reaction equation (6.2). \\[\\begin{equation} SO_4^{2-} + 8 e^- + 10 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons H_2S + 4 H_2O \\tag{6.2} \\end{equation}\\] Here again, to balance the half-reaction, 8 electrons were needed. And by now, this should not surprise you because you now remember that the electron allocation rules tell you that on sulfate and dihydrogen sulfide, the S atom respectively has 0 and 8 electrons for itself. So the reduction of sulfate into dihydrogen sulfide requires the addition of 8 electrons, and guess what? Half-reaction (6.2) confirms just that. While the electron donor is still organic matter as shown in Figure 6.10, the overall transfer of electron from the OM to sulfate can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} 2 CH_2O + SO_4^{2-} + 2 H^+ \\rightarrow H_2S + 2 CO_2 + 2 H_2O \\tag{6.3} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 6.10: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic sulfate reduction Typical concentrations of sulfate in ground- and stream waters are between 1 and 10 mg SO42-/L. In our theoretical wetland soil profile, sulfate that might be originally present in the porewater will be reduced in layers 5 and 6 of Figure 6.2. For the same reasons invoked for oxygen and nitrate, the potential source of supply for sulfate for the sulfate reducing layer is all the sulfate that might be present in the layers above and the water column. The demand for sulfate in layer 5 will create a downward concentration gradient which will generate a downward diffusive movement of sulfate down to layer 5. And again, because of all the diffusion distance, the supply of SO42- is limited and does not match the demand. The imbalance between the sulfate supply and demand will limit the diffusion of sulfate to the bottom of layer 5, below which there will be no more sulfate. 6.7 The methanogenesis oddity The last redox reactions to take place at the bottom of our theoretical wetland soil uses CO2 as the electron acceptor. Interestingly, the generic organic matter is no longer the electron donor, but is replaced by two byproducts of fermentation processes: H2 and acetic acid CH3COOH as illustrated in Figure 6.11. Figure 6.11: Respiration scheme for the heterotrophic Carbon dioxide reduction or methanogenesis The fermentation products are beyond the scope of this class so, we will not come back to that, but it is important to recognize that H2 and CH3COOH can donate electrons as shown in these half-reactions: \\[\\begin{equation} H_2 \\rightleftharpoons 2H^+ + 2 e^- \\tag{6.4} \\end{equation}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation} CH_3COOH + 2 H_2O \\rightleftharpoons 2 CO_2 + 8 H^+ + 8 e^- \\tag{6.5} \\end{equation}\\] 6.8 First summary on the electron acceptor chain in wetland soils except for methanogenesis, organic matter always serves, for organotrophs, as the electron donor. Moreover, it is exclusively the Carbon of the OM which provides the electrons. as a result, the byproducts of the oxidation of the OM when the organic carbons lose their electrons are always the same: CO2, NH4+, H2S/HS-, and PO43- (but for methanogenesis). This means that at one point, all of these four (five if one counts both H2S and HS-, their exact proportion depends on pH, see details in the glossary) molecules will accumulate where they are produced unless they are used by another process To the contrary, the byproducts of the reduction of the electron acceptors are variable and depend on the electron acceptor. In the case of incomplete denitrification, and in the case of methanogenesis, N2O and CH4 are significant greenhouse gases. 6.9 Supply and demand of electron acceptors and of the byproducts of Organic Matter oxidation Now that we have established the reduction processes of the different electron acceptors at play, let us look at the consequences of the demands and the supplies associated with the respiratory processes. 6.9.1 Demands drive downward fluxes of dioxygen, nitrate and sulfate In the Figure 6.12 below, the general directions of the fluxes of electrons acceptors and byproducts of respiration are illustrated for our theoretical wetland soil. The processes taken together is sometimes referred to as soil or sediment diagenesis and all the processes in there are then collectively referred to as diagenetic processes. Figure 6.12: Diffusion fluxes of electron acceptors and all other soil diagenesis processes of a theoretical layered wetland soil The demands for dioxygen, nitrate, and sulfate in their respective layers, lower their concentrations compared to the overlying water and layers, hence the formation of concentration gradients, which then drive downward diffusive fluxes of these electron acceptors to their respective layers. These fluxes are represented as downward arrows in Figure 6.12. Now, it is the imbalance between the supply from above and the demand from below, that explain why the downward diffusion does not go beyond the bottom of the respective layers 1, 2, and 5 in Figure 6.12. The limitation of supply has been described for dioxygen in section 6.2. The diffusivity, distance, and tortuosity of the soil pores also apply for nitrate and sulfate, and explain why the demand is generally not met by the supply. 6.9.2 Supply of byproducts of organic matter oxidation For every respiration process described above (except for methanogenesis), the byproducts are: CO2, NH4+, H2S/HS-, and PO43-. This suggests that in every single layer, there is a supply of all for of these byproducts. Inevitably, this will create an upward concentration gradient, which will then be followed by an upward flux of these four molecules in the sediment. Phosphate will thus dissolve upward, at least until it reaches the aerobic layer. There it might encounter soil mineral oxides where it might bind, as we shall see in future chapters, hence the tips of the arrows not reaching the soil-water interface. However, it is possible that, if the aerobic layer is very thin and the mineral oxides are scarce in this thin layer, phosphates may diffuse all the way into the water column, hence the dotted arrow. 6.9.3 Nitrification Similarly, because of ammonium production in all the layers, but that of methanogenesis, ammonium will diffuse upward, until it reaches the aerobic layer. Remember that the nitrogen atom on the ammonium carries 8 electrons for itself, so it potentially carries a lot of energy. And yes, you guessed right, microbes called nitrifiers take advantage of these electrons and use ammonium as their electron donors, and use O2 as their electron acceptor. Because the electron donor this time is not an organic molecule, nitrifiers are called lithotrophs. Nitrification is represented in Figure 6.12 as the horizontal white arrow to the left. The nitrification respiration schemes is summarized in Figure 6.13. Figure 6.13: Respiration scheme for nitrification Depending on the thickness of the aerobic layer and the availability of dioxygen, all or only a portion of the ammonium may get nitrified as ammonium moves upward, hence the dotted arrow going all the way to the water column. As nitrate is now produced in the aerobic layer of the soil, then the concentration gradient may sway upward or remain downward, depending on the nitrate concentration in the water column, hence the upward nitrate dotted arrow in Figure 6.12. You may also notice that a dotted white arrow pointing the left has been added to illustrate nitrification which tends to readily occur in the water column, often thanks to nitrifiers attached at the soil-water interface. In reality nitrification involves two stages: the oxidation of ammonium into nitrite, performed by ammonium oxidizing bacteria, of which two important genera are Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococcus, and then the oxidation of nitrite into nitrate, performed by Nitrobacter and Nitrospira bacteria (Equation (6.6)). But as far as we are concerned, both steps tend to occur almost simultaneously, and nitrite is thermodynamically unstable, and as a result very little tends to accumulate, either in soil or sediment. \\[\\begin{equation} NH_4^+ \\rightarrow NO_2^- \\rightarrow NO_3^- \\tag{6.6} \\end{equation}\\] Work in progress Denitrification chain image here. By Uswbios - https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=24910639 6.9.4 Gas bubble formation Among the last two OM oxidation byproducts, CO2 and H2S are gases. We saw earlier, that in reality the balance between H2S and HS- depends on the pH. In rather organic soils, which most treatment wetland soils are, the pH tends to be rather acidic, often below 6.5. So it is fair to represent the H2S/HS- couple as H2S rather than HS- (see H2S/HS- Figure), hence the choice of H2S in Figure 6.12 and the use of H2S below. So in the end, if the summation of partial pressure of these and all other dissolved gases exceeds 1 atm + the hydraulic head, gas bubble will form and migrate upward. But because of surface tension forces, gas bubbles tend to get rather easily trapped in wetland soils and sediment. Hence the release of wetland gases when somebody or something disturbs the sediment, as we have seen in lab. To these two gases, one should add the production of CH4 in the methanogenesis layer, which will readily ‘join’ the gas bubbles and the ride with them. The dissolved fraction will also tend to move upward because of the concentration gradient. Interestingly, methane does not oxidized very well in normal aerobic conditions of wetland soils, and will therefore tend to diffuse all the way up to the water column as illustrated in Figure 6.12. Because of the demand for CO2 in the methanogenesis layer, downward arrows have been added for layers 4 and 5 in Figure 6.12. The downward diffusion would only apply for the dissolved CO2 as the gaseous form would obviously tend to move upward. 6.9.5 Oxidation of upward moving reduced sulfur Similarly to ammonium, and although a good proportion of H2S will end up in the gas phase, a still significant amount will stay in solution and will diffuse upward until it reaches the aerobic layer. Very similarly to ammonium, H2S still carries 8 electrons, which can be used for respiration provided that a strong enough oxidizer be present. In the aerobic layer of the sediment, H2S will be oxidized back into sulfate following the respiration scheme in Figure 6.14 Figure 6.14: Respiration scheme for hydrogen sulfide oxidation The bacteria taking advantage of the electrons on sulfur of H2S are called sulfur oxidizing bacteria. There are different from the sulfur reducing bacteria which use OM as their electron donors, and sulfate as their electron acceptors. The oxidation of H2S has been summarized by the white horizontal arrow in both the aerobic layer of the soil and the water column. Sulfate produced can then diffuse back downward to layer 5 in Figure 6.12. 6.9.6 Oxidation of upward moving Mn2+ and Fe2+ The last direct reduction byproducts of respiration processes include Mn2+ and Fe2+. Because they are being produced in layers 3 and below, an upward concentration gradient will be created, followed by an upward movement of Mn2+ and Fe2+. In Figure 6.12, both of them have been represented as starting to move up from layers 4. In all logic, Mn2+ and Fe2 should start moving upward as low as layer 6 because our original hypothesis was that soil was suddenly flooded, so in the temporal sequence of electron acceptors, before sulfate carbon dioxide reduction conditions would prevail in Layers 5 and 6, respectively, the Mn and Fe oxides will serve as electron acceptors, and Mn2+ and Fe2+ will then be produced. The more important fact is the fate of both Mn2+ and Fe2+ as they reach the aerobic layer. Because they are both reduced, they potentially have one electron to give, and yes, some bacteria have specialized in the ability to oxidize these ions. These bacteria are referred to as manganese and iron oxidizing bacteria. The respiration scheme corresponding to iron oxidation is illustrated in Figure 6.15 below. Figure 6.15: Respiration scheme for iron oxidation As both Mn2+ and Fe2+ get oxidized in the aerobic layer of the sediment, they form Mn and Fe oxides, which are solids and precipitates with the other soil minerals, hence the underlying and downward pointing arrows under the MnO2 and Fe3+ in Figure 6.12. The precipitation of iron oxides or hydroxides can be quite visually spectacular sometimes as reduced groundwater seeps out into the open. Iron can get very quickly oxidized and form rusty biofilms. Figure 6.16: Picture of an ‘iron seep’ in Goldsboro, NC, as reduced groundwater gets oxidized in contact with air 6.9.7 Moving of Dissolved Organic Carbon The last but not least of the processes at play in diagenesis is the formation and diffusion of Dissolved Organic Carbon in poorly or anoxic soils. This is the subject of a future chapter. This concludes this long chapter on the importance respiration processes occurring in wetland soils. References "],

The concentration of any constituent in water is determined by the dynamic equilibrium between supply and demand rates. The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) does not escape this simple rule. 7.1.1 The supply and demand of O2 in water The equilibrium between atmospheric O2 and that in the aqueous phase is discussed in details in this chapter. At this point, it is only important to understand that the activities, used in the chemistry sense here, are the same for elements in different phases at equilibrium. As a result, at equilibrium, there is O2 dissolved in water and the amount dissolved depends, in conditions where there is no demand, mainly on the temperature and on the velocity of water. The colder the water, the higher the concentrations, and the warmer the water, the smaller the concentrations. For example, at 5°C one can calculate that the equilibrium concentration is 12.8 mg/L, while at 20°C, it is 9.2 mg/L. We will see in this chapter that the reaeration of water, i.e., the kinetics at which O2 can dissolved into water depends on its turbulence: at low velocity, the reaeration is low, and at high velocity it is high. Additionally, the rate of supply of O2 to water may be affected by photosynthesis, which creates an endogenous additional source. The demand of oxygen in water comes from all aerobic respiratory processes existing in the water column itself (e.g., mineralization, nitrification, etc.) plus those existing in the bottom substrate. The final DO concentration results from the equilibrium between the supply and demand rates. When the potential for supply is much higher (e.g., swift cold stream) than the potential for demand, the DO concentrations are high (e.g., &gt; 6 mg/L). To the contrary, when the potential for supply is low (e.g., stagnant warm wetland water) and the potential for demand high (e.g., the same warm organic rich wetland), the DO concentrations will equilibrate at low concentrations (e.g., &lt; 2 mg/L). In the end, the level of concentration of DO, does determine the level of activity of aerobic respiratory processes in streams, which has consequences on the concentration levels of important inorganic and organic elements. 7.2 Level of nutrient concentrations in natural undisturbed streams This chapter is still under construction "],

They are ordered in alphabetical list for better retrieval and look up. 8.1 A 8.1.1 Aerobic respiration 8.1.2 Anaerobic respiration 8.1.3 Ammonia Ammonia is a colorless gas with a characteristic pungent smell Formula: \\(NH_3\\) Ammonia 3D shape: Lewis dot structure: Number of electron N has for itself following electronegativity rule: eight \\(NH_3\\) can only be an electron donor Because N has so many electrons to be potentially donated, ammonia is generally unstable in an aerobic environment. As a result, it tends to trace quantities in nature When dissolved in water, and depending on the pH of the solution, ammonia converts to ammonium following the reaction: \\[ H_2O + NH_3 \\rightleftharpoons OH^{-} + NH_4^{+} \\] Production: Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals. Dozens of chemical plants worldwide produce ammonia. Consuming more than 1% of all man-made power, ammonia production is a significant component of the world energy budget. In 2014, about 88% of the ammonia produced was used for fertilizing agricultural crops Modern ammonia-producing plants generally depend on the Haber-Bosch process which consists into reducing dinitrogen into ammonia \\[ 3\\,H_2 + N_2 \\to 2\\,NH_3 \\] Consumption: Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen-containing compounds. Virtually all synthetic nitrogen compounds are derived from ammonia. back to top 8.1.4 Ammonium Ammonium is the most reduced inorganic nitrogenous cation (positively charged). Ammonium 3D shape: Lewis dot structure: Number of electron N has for itself following electronegativity rule: eight It is formed by the protonation of ammonia following the reaction: \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O + NH_3 \\rightleftharpoons OH^{-} + NH_4^{+} \\tag{8.1} \\end{equation}\\] The relative abundance of ammonium vs ammonia depends on the pH of the solution. See figure below Because in most natural aqueous environments, pH is below 8, ammonium tends to be the preponderant form. Production: In nature, ammonium is a waste product of the mineralization of organic molecules It is added as fertilizer on soils as ammonium nitrate Health hazard: Ammonia vapor has a sharp, irritating, pungent odor that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death Drinking water standard: back to top 8.1.5 Ammonium nitrate Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound, the nitrate salt of the ammonium cation It is a white crystal solid and is highly soluble in water. Formula: \\(NH_4NO_3\\) 3D shape: It is predominantly used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer Its other major use is as a component of explosive mixtures used in mining, quarrying, and civil construction Production: Ammonium nitrate does exist naturally in mines of the Atacama desert in Chile but globally nearly all ammonium nitrate is now produced synthetically Byproduct of all respiration processes. Ammonium ions are a waste product of the metabolism of animals. In fish and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the urea cycle to urea, because urea is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into uric acid, which is solid and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss. Consumption/utilization: It is used as a fertilizer, because it tends to release inorganic nitrogen slowly in soil. Applied as a surface fertilizer, it penetrates the soil with rainfall infiltration. Highly soluble, the nitrate anion becomes readily available to plant roots, although it is susceptible to leaching below the root system into the shallow and deep groundwater. The ammonium cation tends to adsorb to soil particles and is thus not as susceptible to leaching. Ammonium can be directly uptaken by plant roots, which thermodynamically makes sense, although because in most soils aerobic conditions are preponderant, nitrate tends to be the ion uptaken most often. Soil bacteria in the aerobic zone of the soil will oxidize adsorbed ammonium into nitrate, which then becomes available for plant roots. The whole chain of events slows the release of inorganic nitrogen to crops and thus makes for more effective fertilizers. Health hazard No direct known health hazard back to top 8.1.6 Anoxic waters Anoxic waters are areas of sea water, fresh water, or groundwater that are depleted of dissolved oxygen and are a more severe condition of hypoxia (Wikipedia) Anoxic waters result from an IMBALANCE between oxygen supply and demand back to top 8.2 B 8.2.1 Benthic Of, relating to, or occurring at the bottom of a body of water Merriam-Webster dictionary, 2018. Benthic sediment losely corresponds to the layer where life micro- and macroorganisms are present. The organisms living in this zone are referred to as benthos. 8.3 C 8.3.1 Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a colorless gas which density is 50% higher than that of dry air. Formula: CO2 Carbon dioxide 3D shape: Lewis dot structure: Number of electron C has for itself following electronegativity rule: zero CO2 can only be an electron acceptor Production: oxidation of C in all organic molecules Almost all respiratory processes on earth (some respiration does not involve oxidation of C) Combustion of all Carbon-based fuel Consumption: Photosynthesis Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the primary carbon source for life on Earth Calcite precipitation in the oceans Ecological Significance: Greenhouse Gas, which serves as reference for all other GHG Concentration in the atmosphere ~380 ppm on the rise, or 0.38%, or a partial pressure of 0.38 atm Carbon Dioxide variations through ancient and modern times concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from hundreds of thousands of years ago through 2015, measured in parts per million (ppm). The data come from a variety of historical ice core studies and recent air monitoring sites around the world. Each line represents a different data source (EPA 2016) In reality, concentrations are not stable, and vary widely in time and in space at the next two videos nicely show. The next one results from the model simulations Youtube video of CO2 modeled seasonal variations - The following one is the combination of both models and observations Youtube video of CO2 modeled and observed seasonal variations back to top 8.3.2 Carbonates After carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it will combine with water to form carbonic acid (\\(H_2CO_3\\)). Carbonate serves as the carbon source for aquatic vegetation Carbonic acid can then dissociate into bicarbonate (\\(HCO_3^-\\)) and carbonate (\\(CO_3^{2-}\\)) The term “bicarbonate” was coined in 1814 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston. The prefix “bi” in “bicarbonate” comes from an outdated naming system and is based on the observation that there is twice as much carbonate (CO32−) per sodium ion in sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and other bicarbonates than in sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and other carbonates. The name lives on as a trivial name. (Wikipedia contributors 2018a). \\[\\begin{align} H_2CO_3 &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; HCO_3^- + H^+ \\tag{8.2} \\\\ HCO_3^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; CO_3^{2-} + H^+ \\tag{8.3} \\end{align}\\] In an environment not open to the atmosphere (or where direct exchange with the atmosphere is very limited like in stream or wetland sediment), the preponderant form depends on the pH and can be calculated as illustrated on the graph below. Carbon dioxide and carbonates are fully oxidized forms of inorganic molecules with just one atom of C: the carbon atom has zero electrons for itself as shown in Figure 8.1 Figure 8.1: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of C, including from left to right CO2, carbonic acid, hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate), and carbonate, showing that the C atoms have no electrons for themselves In sea water, Carbonate can combine with Ca2+ to form Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3), which precipitates out of solution. In other words, calcium carbonate formation is a sink for carbonate, and ultimately from CO2 addition from the atmosphere to to increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Carbonates are thus a great pH buffer in aquatic environments 8.3.3 Catabolism Reactions involving the breaking down of organic substrates, typically by oxidative breakdown, to provide chemically available energy (e.g. A TP) and/or to generate metabolic intermediates used in subsequent anabolic reactions (De Bolster 1997). Synonyms: Aerobic and anaerobic respirations which use organic molecules as electron donors, are synonyms of catabolism. In soil science another synonym of catabolism is mineralization, which refers to the decomposition or oxidation of the chemical compounds in organic matter releasing the nutrients contained in those compounds into soluble inorganic forms that may be plant-accessible (Wikipedia contributors 2018d). 8.4 D 8.4.1 Denitrification The microbially mediated dissimilatory reduction of nitrate into dinitrogen see denitrification in chapters for more details 8.4.2 Dihydrogen sulfide see hydrogen sulfide back to top 8.5 E 8.5.1 Eutrophication Definitions: ‘an increase in the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem’ (Nixon 1995) ‘is the enrichment of a water body with nutrients, usually with an excess amount of nutrients’ (Wikipedia) ‘the enrichment of water by nutrients, especially nitrogen and/or phosphorus, causing an accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms present in the water and to the quality of water concerned’ (Anonymous 1991b) ‘the enrichment of water by nitrogen compounds causing an accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms present in the water and to the quality of water concerned’ (Anonymous 1991a) back to top 8.6 F 8.6.1 Fischer projection see Structural formula back to top 8.7 G 8.7.1 Greenhouse gases (GHG) A greenhouse gas is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth’s surface would be about −18 °C (0 °F), rather than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F). In the Solar System, the atmospheres of Venus, Mars and Titan also contain gases that cause a greenhouse effect.

It is very poisonous, corrosive, flammable and acidic in nature. Formula: \\(H_2S\\) hydrogen sulfide #D shape: Lewis dot structure: Number of electron S has for itself following electronegativity rule: eight \\(H_2S\\) can only be an electron donor Unstable under aerobic conditions, will readily be oxidized into sulfate \\(H_2S\\) is a polyprotic acid which can lose up to 2 protons in water, depending on the pH. \\[\\begin{align} H_2S &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; HS^- + H^+ \\tag{8.4} \\\\ HS^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; S^{2-}+ H^+ \\tag{8.5} \\end{align}\\] The figure below suggests that at pH found in most streams (4.5 to 8), \\(H_2S\\) is either preponderant or corresponds to at least 20% of all sulfide forms. \\(H_2S\\) being a highly volatile product, it explains why we can easily smell and detect it in most conditions in streams. Production: Hydrogen sulfide often results from the microbial breakdown, or mineralization, of organic matter in anaerobic conditions, such as may exist in swamps and sewers. When happening in sediment, this is referred to as sediment diagenesis Consumption: back to top 8.9 L 8.9.1 Lithotrophs Lithotrophs are a diverse group of organisms using inorganic substrate (usually of mineral origin) to obtain reducing equivalents for use in biosynthesis (e.g., carbon dioxide fixation) or energy conservation (i.e., ATP production) via aerobic or anaerobic respiration. Known chemolithotrophs are exclusively microorganisms. (Wikipedia contributors 2018c) back to top 8.9.2 Limiting factor back to top 8.10 M 8.10.1 Methane Under normal conditions for temperature and pressure, methane is a colorless, odorless gas main constituent of natural gas, and the simplest alkane Formula: \\(CH_4\\) Methane 3D shape: Lewis dot structure of methane: Number of electron C has for itself following electronegativity rule: eight \\(CH_4\\) can only be an electron donor Because methane has so many electrons to give, it will easily ‘burn’ in normal atmosphere (provided that ignition T°C be reached, e.g., by a spark), liberating large quantities of heat (55.5 MJ/kg). The electrons are transferred from the carbon to the oxygen atoms following two redox half-reactions to obtain the overall reaction: \\[\\begin{align} CH_4 + 2\\,H_2O &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; CO_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^-\\\\ 2\\,O_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; 4\\,H_2O\\\\ &amp; &amp;\\\\ \\hline\\\\ CH_4 + 2\\,O_2 &amp; \\to &amp; CO_2 + 2\\,H_2O \\end{align}\\] Production: Consumption: Ecological significance: Concentrations of methane in the atmosphere from hundreds of thousands of years ago through 2015, measured in parts per billion (ppb). The data come from a variety of historical ice core studies and recent air monitoring sites around the world. Each line represents a different data source(EPA 2016) Health effects: 8.10.2 Mineralization see catabolism 8.11 N 8.11.1 Nitrate Nitrate is the stable inorganic nitrogenous anion in oxidized water Formula: \\(NO_3^{-}\\) Nitrate 3D shape: Lewis dot structure of nitrate: Number of electron N has for itself following electronegativity rule: zero \\(NO_3^{-}\\) can only be an electron acceptor \\(NO_3^{-}\\) is technically the conjugate base of nitric acid \\(HNO_3\\), but the \\(pk_A\\) of the reaction is at a theoretical pH of -1.38. In other words, for the pH of most natural waters (4.5 &lt; pH &lt; 8), \\(HNO_3\\) is totally insignificant. Production: from the complete oxidation of inorganic nitrogenous molecules which include ammonia, ammonium, nitrite from the mineralization and complete oxidation of amine radicals in organic molecules Consumption: Uptake from microbes, plants, and algae for their anabolism, which consists in building complex organic molecules from inorganic ones. Uptake, assimilation, anabolism, immobilization are all synonymous terms to express the fact that the N atom is immobilized, at least temporarily in organic molecules. Because N is assimilated in organic molecules during uptake/anabolism, and because N gains electrons in the process (it is thus reduced), we refer to nitrate uptake as assimilatory nitrate reduction. Denitrification: under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is used by facultative anaerobes as electron acceptor to generate ATP in their respiration chain. The two major end products of denitrification are gases, namely dinitrogen (\\(N_2\\)) and nitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\)), which leave the aqueous environment. As such, nitrate is not assimilated by any bacteria and denitrification is therefore, as opposed to uptake, referred to as **dissimilatory nitrate reduction into dinitrogen (\\(N_2\\)) and nitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\)). Ecological significance: Because of assimilation and denitrification processes, the overall nitrate concentrations in rivers tends to diminish from the catchment headwaters to the receiving bodies such as estuaries and coastal areas. As a result, inorganic nitrogen has naturally been in very short supply in these coastal water bodies, and nitrate and traditionally been the nutrient limiting aquatic productivity there. Very much like with phosphate, algae have adapted to be able to grow in very low concentrations. Anthropogenic activities, and agriculture in particular, have largely increased the loads and concentration of nitrate reaching estuaries, to the point where nitrate is no longer the limiting factor. As a result, excess nitrate is one of the reasons for the global and persistent presence of algal blooms in estuaries and coastal waters. Health hazard: There is a heated debate about the health hazard that nitrate might pose. Some argue that if anything, there might be beneficial effects, while others argue that there are evidence of cancers linked to excess nitrate absorption. Unfortunately, arguments on both sides might not be totally independent of militantism and lobbies. The only consensus everybody seems to agree upon is the Blue Baby syndrome, or methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobinemia is an unusual and potentially fatal condition in which hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin and loses its ability to bind and transport oxygen, hence the cyanosis (blue appearance) usually visible on fingers, toes, and lips. Nitrate reduced to nitrite in the body of humans and animals enters the body stream where it seems to directly oxidize oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin-peroxide complex. Picture of a Blue Baby from syndromespedia.com/blue-baby-syndrome.html Drinking water standards Although there is still a heated debate whether or not nitrate does have have detrimental health effects, the World Health Organization has provided maximum concentration guidelines of 50 mg/L as nitrate (World Health Organization 2011). These guidelines have been enacted in hard laws in the US and in Europe. The 50 mg/L as nitrate equates 11.2 mg \\(NO_3\\)-N/L and in the US, the drinking water standard is 10 mg \\(NO_3\\)-N/L. back to top 8.11.2 Nitrous Oxide Commonly known as laughing gas Nitrous oxide has significant medical uses, especially in surgery and dentistry, for its anesthetic and pain reducing effects. Formula: \\(N_2O\\) Nitrous Oxide 3D shape: Number of electron N has for itself following electronegativity rule: the first one on the left has 5 the middle N has 3 \\(N_2O\\) can be both an electron acceptor and an electron donor Production: \\(N_2O\\) is produced due to bacterial processes (over 90%) and anthropogenic processes such as burning of fossil fuel The two main bacterial processes are nitrification and denitrification Accounting that human activities have enhanced both nitrification and denitrification processes, it is estimated that overall, about 2/3rd of \\(N_2O\\) production is natural, and about 1/3rd is human enhanced Consumption: Because of all the electrons stored on the two N atoms (5 + 3 = 8), nitrous oxide is a potential electron donor and bacteria can use it for their respiration processes Ecological significance: Powerful Greenhouse Gas, 298 times that of CO2 (EPA) Concentration in the atmosphere ~0.0003 ppm or ~325 ppb on the rise Concentrations of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere from hundreds of thousands of years ago through 2015, measured in parts per billion (ppb). The data come from a variety of historical ice core studies and recent air monitoring sites around the world. Each line represents a different data source)(EPA 2016) back to top 8.12 O 8.12.1 Oligotrophication ‘a decrease in the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem’ (Nixon 2009) back to top 8.12.2 Oxidation Oxidation is the loss of electrons by a molecule, atom, or ion. The term oxidation was first used by Antoine Lavoisier to signify reaction of a substance with oxygen. Much later, it was realized that the substance, upon being oxidized, loses electrons, and the meaning was extended to include other reactions in which electrons are lost. back to top 8.12.3 Oxidation state The oxidation state (OS), or sometimes referred to as the oxidation number, quantifies the number of electrons that an atom has gained (expressed as negative charge value) or lost (expressed as positive charge value) compared to the number of valence electrons it has in its free form. As a result, it can be zero, positive or negative. For metal ions, the OS corresponds to its charge The change in oxidation state is a very powerful tool to understand the redox processes involved in the environement. But OS is less than ideal when comparing the absolute number of electrons one element has for itself For example, the nitrogen atom N, has 5 valence electrons. In the dinitrogen molecule N2, the Lewis dot structure suggests that each atom share 3 electrons with the other but essentially have 5 electrons for themselves as in Figure 8.2 Figure 8.2: Electron allocation on each of the N atom for the dinitrogen molecule N2 As a result, the number of electron on each atom equals the number of valence electrons on the free form of N, hence OS = 0. Now in the nitrous oxide case in Figure 8.3, the nitrogen atom to the left OS = 0, but for the middle Nitrogen atom, OS = -2, as two electrons were stripped by oxygen. Figure 8.3: Electron allocation on each of the N atom for the N2O molecule The problem with the oxidation state indicator is that it is a relative number, and not absolute. The electron allocation indicator that quantifies the number of electrons each atom has for itself is more abolute and thus comparable. For example, the inorganic molecule with one C atom stable in an oxidized environment is CO2, the inorganic molecule with one N atom stable in an oxidized environment is \\(NO_3^-\\), and the inorganic molecule with one S atom stable in an oxidized environment is \\(SO_4^{2-}\\). All three atoms have zero electrons for themselves as oxygen has ‘stolen’ them (Figure 8.4). So they are all potential electron acceptors that can accept up to 8 electrons. In a way they are very similar. Figure 8.4: Electron allocation on each of the C, N, and S atom for the CO2, nitrate and sulfate molecules But if one calculates the oxidation states for each of the C, N, and S atoms, for these three molecules, one would find OSC = -4, OSN = -5, and OSS = -6… We believe this can be very confusing and prefer to use the electron allocation concept as a more absolute indicator. back to top 8.13 P 8.13.1 Phosphate Phosphate is an inorganic chemical and a salt-forming anion of phosphoric acid Formula: \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) Phosphate is one of the anions of the polyprotic acid (i.e., which can liberate several protons \\(H^{+}\\)) The conjugate bases of phosphate are: All conjugate bases are related through the set acid-base chemical equilibria: \\[\\begin{align} H_3PO_4 &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; H_2PO_4^- + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 2.12}\\\\ H_2PO_4^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; HPO_4^{2-} + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 7.21}\\\\ HPO_4^{2-}&amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; PO_4^{3-} + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 12.67} \\end{align}\\] The preponderant form of phosphate in a solution also depends on the pH following this relationship: The phosphoric acid and phosphates are fully oxidized forms of inorganic molecules with just one atom of P: the Phosphorus atom has zero electrons for itself as shown in Figure 8.5 below: Figure 8.5: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of P, including from left to right Phosphoric acid, dihydrogen Phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, and phosphate , showing that the P atoms have no electrons for themselves Production: Phosphorus in general and phosphate in practice has remained one of the nutrients limiting the most plant productivity on our planet Phosphates are the naturally occurring form of the element phosphorus, found in many phosphate minerals Phosphate minerals are mined to obtain phosphorus for use in agriculture and industry The largest global producer and exporter of phosphates is Morocco. Within North America, the largest deposits lie in the Bone Valley region of central Florida, the Soda Springs region of southeastern Idaho, and the coast of North Carolina (near Aurora). Consumption: Uptake from all primary producer including plants and algae Phosphate can also be immobilized by bacteria In food industry, phosphates help baked goods rise, they act as emulsifiers in processed cheese and canned soup, they add flavor to cola and color to frozen french fries. They also can be added to meat, poultry and seafood to help the protein bind more water, making it juicier after freezing and reheating. Ecological significance: Phosphorus as phosphate naturally is the most limiting factor for primary productivity for land and aquatic plants. Because it tends to bind to particles, phosphates have accumulated with sediment particularly in coastal areas, where phosphate can become available again to algae through sediment diagenetic processes. As a result, phosphate is generally not considered the most limiting factor for algae in estuaries and coastal environment. However, it does tend to be the limiting nutrient in freshwater receiving bodies such as lakes and reservoirs. Excess phosphate in freshwater receiving bodies has been shown to be the nutrient causing some major eutrophication problems throughout the planet back to top 8.14 R 8.14.1 Reactive nitrogen back to top 8.14.2 Redox Redox (short for reduction–oxidation reaction) is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed. Any such reaction involves both a reduction process and a complementary oxidation process, effectively allowing the electron transfer processes. 8.14.3 Redox couple redox couples, commonly noted as ‘Ox/Red’ refer to the two forms that an element might take depending on its oxidation state Ox in ‘Ox/Red’ refers to as the oxidizer or oxidizing agent, as it has the capability to make other elements lose their electrons. Red in ‘Ox/Red’ refers to as the reducer or reducing agent, as it has the capability to give electrons to other elements Common redox couples which matter in environmental and ecological engineering include: CO2/CH2O O2/H2O NO3-/N2 NO3-/NH4+ NO3-/NO2- MnO2/Mn2+ Fe3+/Fe2+ SO42-/H2S CO2/CH4 8.14.4 Redox half-reactions A half reaction is either the oxidation or reduction reaction component of a redox reaction. A half reaction is obtained by considering the change in oxidation states of individual substances involved in the redox reaction (Wikipedia contributors 2018b) Redox half reactions illustrate the transfer of electrons from the oxidized form of an element to a reduced form of an element. Half-reactions are often used as a method of balancing redox reactions To derive half-reactions, the first convention is that the oxidizer is on the left of the equation, and the reducer on the right one must first equilibrate all elements other than O and H then one balances for O, by adding H2O on the appropriate side of the half reaction then one adds the appropriate number of H+ to balance the H Finally one adds the appropriate number of e- to balance the charge. The number of e- must correspond to the change in oxidation state The half-reactions corresponding to the redox couples above are: CO2/CH2O \\[\\begin{equation} CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightleftharpoons CH_2O + H_2O \\end{equation}\\] CH2O here is a generic formula to represent the electron donating capacity of OM. This equation might be misleading as it corresponds to the OM donating 4 electrons in the respiration schemes, but because it is written using the ox/red convention, is the opposite of the intuitive direction. So a more intuitive half-reaction might be, and is effectively what is used to write the full redox reaction: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\end{equation}\\] O2/H2O \\[\\begin{equation} O_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightleftharpoons 4H_2O \\end{equation}\\] NO3-/N2 \\[\\begin{equation} 2 NO_3^- + 10 e^- + 12 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons N_2 + 6 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] MnO2/Mn2+ \\[\\begin{equation} MnO_2 + 4 e^- + 4 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons Mn^{2+} + 2 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] Fe3+/Fe2+ \\[\\begin{equation} Fe^{3+} + 1 e^- \\rightleftharpoons Fe^{2+} \\\\ \\end{equation}\\] SO42-/H2S \\[\\begin{equation} SO_4^{2-} + 8 e^- + 10 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons H_2S + 4 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] CO2/CH4 \\[\\begin{equation} CO_2 + 8 e^- + 8 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons CH_4 + 2 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] a redox reaction always involves two half reactions where the electrons are transfered from the lowest redox potential couple to the highest redox potential couple. For example, the combustion of methane in oxygen involves the two O2/H2O and CO2/CH4 couples. The half-reaction of the highest redox potential couple goes on top, and that of the lowest potential at the bottom, but this time written as red/ox like in the equation below: \\[\\begin{align} 2\\,O_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; 4\\,H_2O\\\\ CH_4 + 2\\,H_2O &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; CO_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^-\\\\ &amp; &amp;\\\\ \\hline\\\\ CH_4 + 2\\,O_2 &amp; \\to &amp; CO_2 + 2\\,H_2O \\end{align}\\] The electrons cancel out, and in this case the protons as well. So the combustion of methane, which is very simple at first glance, really involves a transfer of electrons, which the half-reactions reveal. 8.14.5 Reduction Reduction is the gain of electrons by a molecule, atom, or ion. back to top 8.15 S 8.15.1 Skeletal formula The skeletal formula, also called line-angle formula or shorthand formula, of an organic compound is a type of molecular structural formula that serves as a shorthand representation of a molecule’s bonding and some details of its molecular geometry (Wikipedia contributors 2018g). see Structural formula 8.15.2 Structural formula 8.15.3 Sulfate Sulfate is the inorganic sulfur anion stable in oxidized water Formula: \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) Sulfate 3D shape: Lewis dot structure of nitrate: Number of electron S has for itself following electronegativity rule: zero \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) can only be an electron acceptor \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) is the conjugate base of Hydrogen sulfate \\(HSO_4^{-}\\). The figure below shows that for pH normally measured in surface water and streams (4.5-8), \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) is the truly preponderant form. We therefore generally omit to mention \\(HSO_4^{-}\\) as a chemical form that plays any significant role. During their anabolism, primary producers uptake sulfate, but the sulfur atoms can be incorporated into amino-acids only after sulfur has been reduced, or gained 8 electrons to be in a thiol (\\(-SH\\)) form.

Depending on the source of electrons Lithotrophs Lithotrophs obtain their reducing power or their high energy electrons from inorganic molecules, or mineral matter. Literally, rock eaters. In other words, they obtain their electrons from molecules or atoms like NH4+ or Fe2+.

In reality, at night, phototrophs become chemotrophs as their cellular respiration is based upon oxidizing organic matter. But they are autosufficient. They capture solar energy and store it in a chemical form thanks to photosynthesis, and used that stored energy later on. Just about all green plants are phototrophs.

However, it might be a good thing to have a refresher on what electron orbitals, valence electrons, and Lewis structures are. This appendix proposes a quick refresher on these concepts. A.1.1 Electron orbitals Atoms are made of a nucleus and electrons. The nucleus itself is made of protons and neutrons. In the simplified periodic table below (Figure A.1), the first three lines of the periodic table are represented and the atomic numbers are given for each atom. The atomic number or proton number of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom. It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons (Wikipedia contributors 2018l). Figure A.1: simplified periodic table that show the s and p orbitals for the first 18 atomic numbers (number of protons = number of electrons in each atom) Orbitals express the two waves and particle natures of electrons. At the bottom of each atom box in Figure A.1, one can see odd symbols like 1s2 2s22p2 for the carbon atom. The ‘s’ and ‘p’ letters represent two different electron orbitals. The numbers 1 and 2 before the letter represent the angular momentum of the orbitals, which is also an indication of the electron energy levels. An electron orbital characterizes the high probability of where an electron might be located around the nucleus. Each orbital can be occupied by a maximum of 2 electrons. The wave nature of electrons tells us that the electrons are stable, for a given energy level, in their orbitals. For the biogeochemical processes of this book, we only deal with the CHONSP atoms, which only have s, p, and d orbitals, not f, g, h, etc. What are these bizarre letters s, p, d, f, g, etc. describing orbitals anyway…? They are derived from the description by early spectroscopists of certain series of alkali metal spectroscopic lines as sharp, principal, diffuse, and fundamental&quot; (Wikipedia contributors 2018l). So now, for the low energy level 1, the orbital s appears to be a sphere. In other words the one or two atoms in this orbital will have a very high probability of being in that sphere. The one electron of hydrogen will thus be somewhere in that orbital. For helium, its two electrons will be in this sphere as well and be extremely stable. With only one electron in its orbital, hydrogen is just not very stable, and it ‘tries’ to bond with other atoms such that they can ‘share’ electrons so that the H 1s orbital is ‘visited’ by 2 electrons, which makes hydrogen ‘happy’ and stable. Now, for lithium and Beryllium, which have 3 and 4 electrons (Figure A.1), respectively, their electrons fill a new s orbital, which also is a s orbital with a spherical shape as well, just bigger as the electrons have more energy. Boron and Carbon have 5 and 6 electrons, and their orbitals are not spheres any more. The theory tells that the high probability for these electrons is to be in a space that looks like two ‘eggs’ opposed to each other (Figure A.2). These are called p orbitals. There can be 3 p orbitals which are located along three x,y,z axes with the exact same level of energy. Figure A.2: Shape of the electron orbitals s, p, d, and f. Obtained from https://chem.libretexts.org/ Electron orbitals that have the same energy levels are called degenerate orbitals. The lower energy orbitals are filled before higher energy orbitals. Hund’s rule states that degenerate orbitals are filled evenly before moving to higher energy orbitals. For p orbitals, which consist of three degenerate orbitals that all have exactly the same energy level, we put a single electron in each orbital first then put a second electron (of opposite spin, we have not mentioned spins yet, and will not here) in each orbital to fill them with a total of six electrons. Figure A.3: Hund’s rule to correctly fill in orbitals for the Carbon and Nitrogen atoms. Up and down arrows represent the electron spins. Electrons have to have opposite spins to be located in the same orbital. This has little impact for our purpose The electrons for Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur in their orbitals are represented in Figure A.4 below. you can see that, N and P, and O and S 2p and 3p orbitals, respectively, follow the same ‘filling’ patterns. Figure A.4: Hund’s rule to correctly fill in orbitals for the Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sufur atoms A.2 Orbitals hybridization This is what the theory tells us. In practice, it seems that the interactions of electrons among orbitals, and with bond atoms, make things a little different and new hybrid orbitals actually form. This is the basis of geometrical configuration of molecules and explains the shape of molecules and angles between atoms in a molecule. Does it really matter in biogeochemical processes? Actually quite a bit. Starting with the shape of the water molecule. But before then, let us explain orbital hybridization using the illustration in Figure A.5. Figure A.5: sp, sp2, and sp3 orbital hybridization and illustration for the carbon atom The electronic signature for carbon is 1s2 2s22p2. The Hund’s rule for filling orbitals suggests (Figure A.4) that one of the p orbital has not electron. Orbital hybridization consists in moving one of the electron in the 2s orbital to fill this empty p orbital. But since electrons on the s orbital are much less energetic than the p ones, the electrons in the resulting new hybrid orbitals are not going to be as energetic. Three possible hybrid orbitals exist in nature: sp, sp2, and sp3 orbitals. For the example of carbon, there also are three orbital configurations. The lowest energy hybridization is that the 4 electrons on 2s22p2 end up in four orbitals, i.e., two in 2 sp orbitals and two in 2 p orbitals, one electron in each. This is the configuration illustrated at the bottom row, and application of this configuration is the CO2 molecule (Figure A.5). The mid energetic configuration is also four orbitals, but this time with 3 sp2 orbitals and 1 p orbital. This is the configuration illustrated at the middle row with an application being the aldehyde configuration in a molecule. The highest energy hybrid orbital is referred to as sp3, where the original 2s22p2 are hybridized into 4 sp3 orbitals, leading to a tetrahedral configuration of the orbitals, with methane being an illustration. So, the same atom can practically change its orbital configuration. And all of this depends on the molecule in which this atom is involved. This is true for all atoms, and particularly the ones we are concerned about, i.e., C, N, O, P, and S (H orbital does not change!). Since, hybridizations change depending on molecular configurations (and vice versa), it is time to recall the two types of atomic bonds prevailing in molecules of interest to us: the σ and π bonds. A.3 σ and π bonds In chemistry, sigma bonds (σ bonds) are the strongest type of covalent chemical bond. They are formed by head-on overlapping between atomic orbitals. […] A σ-bond is symmetrical with respect to rotation about the bond axis. […] Sigma bonds are the strongest type of covalent bonds due to the direct overlap of orbitals, and the electrons in these bonds are sometimes referred to as sigma electrons. (Wikipedia contributors 2018i) A covalent bond, also called a molecular bond, is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full outer shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration. (Wikipedia contributors 2018k) For the CHONSP atoms, σ bonds can be formed between s, p, and spn orbitals (Figure A.6). Figure A.6: Examples of σ bonds with different types of overlap, from s, p, and spn orbitals. Obtained freely and modified under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license pi bonds (π bonds) are covalent chemical bonds where two lobes of an orbital on one atom overlap two lobes of an orbital on another atom. The Greek letter π in their name refers to p orbitals, since the orbital symmetry of the pi bond is the same as that of the p orbital when seen down the bond axis. One common form of this sort of bonding involves p orbitals themselves. […] Pi bonds are usually weaker than sigma bonds. (Wikipedia contributors 2018h) Typically, a single bond is a sigma bond while a multiple bond is composed of one sigma bond together with pi or other bonds. A double bond has one sigma plus one pi bond, and a triple bond has one sigma plus two pi bonds. Figure A.7: Examples in the ethylene molecule of σ and π bonds. The full overlap of sp^2 orbitals between the C and H and C and C atoms leads to σ bonds and the overlap between the p orbitals leads to a π bond shown as an elongated blue lobe that extends both above and below the plane of the molecule.

Important examples of molecules where sp, sp2, and sp3 orbitals exist are presented next. Before this, it should be noted that there does not seem to be full consensus on how orbits necessarily form. The orbital hybridization is a model that explains many other observations but remains just a model. There are other models out there but this is beyond the scope of this summary. Additionally, there often are several possibilities of hybridization, and chemistry books do not necessarily agree on what hybrid orbitals atoms take in molecular arrangement. The steric number gives a nice indication on simple molecules on the hybrid orbital the central atom may take. The steric number (SN) is equal to the summation of the number of atoms bound to the central atom + the number of lone pairs left on the central atom. The lone pair can be determined using the Lewis dot structure, presented later in this chapter. The general rule for the molecules we deal with is as such: if SN = 4, the central atom follows a sp3 hybridization if SN = 3, the central atom follows a sp2 hybridization if SN = 2, the central atom follows a sp hybridization A.4 sp3 hybridization examples A.4.1 Methane Methane (SN=4+0=4) is the quintessential example of the hybridization of the Carbon 2s22p2 orbitals into 4 sp3 orbitals. The overlap of the sp3 orbitals of carbon with the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atoms form σ bonds, and create a symmetrical tetrahedral molecular shape. In aliphatic chains, the -[CH2]- are not straight but have angles between consecutive C-C bonds because of the sp3 orbitals. This is one of the reasons for the skeletal formula in organic chemistry (Figure A.8). Figure A.8: The sp3 hybrid orbitals in CH4, Modified from https://www.slideshare.net/pedagogics/2012-orbital-hybrization-sigma-and-pi-bonds A.4.2 The water molecule In the molecule of water, the oxygen (SN=2+2=4) orbitals are hybrid sp3 and two of them from two σ covalent bonds with hydrogen, leaving two sp3 orbitals as two lone pairs or electrons (Figure A.9). Figure A.9: The sp3 hybrid orbitals in H2O, leaving two lone pairs of electrons in two of the orbitals. Obtained freely under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license These lone electron pairs, opposite to the bonds with the H atoms, thus form an important electronic density, rendering the molecules asymmetric both on a geometric and on a charge basis, with the two lone pairs forming a slight electronegative side of the molecule, and the two hydrogen atoms, forming a slight electron positive side of the molecule (Figure A.10). The water molecule: is thus referred to as a polar molecule, i.e., it “has a net dipole as a result of the opposing charges (i.e. having partial positive and partial negative charges) from polar bonds arranged asymmetrically” (Wikipedia contributors 2018n) as a result, water is a good polar solvent that dissolves salts and hydrophilic organic molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, mono-, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. “Because of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules. These bonds are the cause of water’s high surface tension and capillary forces” (Wikipedia contributors 2018r). It is thanks to these capillary forces that, among other things, soils can store very significant amount of water which plants can use for their growth even during drought times. “The hydrogen bonds are also the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of other analogous compounds like hydrogen sulfide (H~2S). They also explain its exceptionally high specific heat capacity (about 4.2 J/g/K), heat of fusion (about 333 J/g), heat of vaporization (2257 J/g), and thermal conductivity (between 0.561 and 0.679 W/m/K). These properties make water more effective at moderating Earth’s climate, by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere.” (Wikipedia contributors 2018r) Figure A.10: Illustration of the electric dipole of the water molecule due slight electronegativities and positivies on the O and H atoms, respectively; Hydrogen bonds are one the consequence the polar nature of water.

A.4.3 Ammonia and Ammonium Similar to water, the electron orbitals for the Nitrogen atom in NH3 (SN=3+1=4) and NH4+ (SN=4+0=4) are hybridized into sp3 orbitals. As a result the ammonia molecule has a pyramidal shape (Figure A.11), leaving a lone pair of electrons in the sp3 orbital opposite to the plan made by the H atoms. This lone pair makes ammonia a base, that is a proton acceptor to form ammonium. Similarly to water, and because of the lone pair or electron, ammonia is a polar molecule and thus has the ability to make hydrogen bonds and is thus highly miscible in water. Ammonium, the protonated form of ammonia, uses the lone pair of electrons of ammonia to create a new bond with a proton to eventually form a positively charged tetrahedral molecule, where all N-H bonds are equivalent, and polar covalent bonds. More details on the protonation of ammonia into ammonium and the equilibria is provided in the glossary. Figure A.11: Orbital configuration for ammonia, NH3. Each N–H σ-bonding orbital, containing 2 electrons, is formed from a N sp3 hybrid orbital and a H 1s orbital. The remaining lone pair of electrons occupies the fourth tetrahedral position producing a pyramidal structure. Obtained freely under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license A.4.4 Sulfate The Lewis dot structure tells us (see below) that there is 2 single bond and 2 double bonds. This makes for a total of 10 shared electrons for sulfur…?! This is possible because sulfur belongs to the third period and has d orbitals open (Figure A.12). The steric number for sulfur in the sulfate molecule (SO42-) is thus SN=4+0=4, suggesting a sp3 orbital hybridization and a tetrahedral geometrical configuration. As a result the sulfate molecule has a pyramidal shape (Figure A.12). Two of the electrons on the filled orbitals 3s and 3p move into 2 of the d orbitals. The π bonds form between the d orbitals and one p orbital of the uncharged oxygen atoms. The σ bonds from from the 4 sp3 orbitals and one p orbital of the negatively charged oxygen atoms (Figure A.12). Figure A.12: Orbital configuration for ammonia, SO42-. Each S–O σ-bonding orbital, containing 2 electrons, is formed from a S sp3 hybrid orbital and a O 2p orbital. The two π bonds are formed from the 3d orbitals and the 2p orbitals of the uncharged oxygen atoms A.4.5 Phosphate Phosphate (PO43-, SN=4+0=4) is probably one of the most fascinating molecule in the living world. Because phosphorus is in the third period of the periodic table, just as sulfur is (Figure A.1), it does not have to follow the octet rules and can accept extra electrons in the d orbitals. Theoretically, the phosphorus orbitals can be hybridized such that the 3s orbital filled with two electrons, and the 3d orbitals filled with one electron each hybridize into 5 sp3 orbitals in the molecule of phosphate. However, in the phosphate molecule, this does not happen. Instead, the hybridization generates 4 sp3 orbitals and one 3d orbitals (Figure A.4). As a result, the phosphate molecule has a tetrahedral steric configuration. Three of the Oxygen atoms gain electrons to become negative and they theoretically do not need to hybridize to from σ bonds using their p orbitals with the sp3 orbitals of the phosphorus. The π bond forms with the 3d orbital left of the phosphorus and the second open 2p orbital of the uncharged O atom. The ‘3-’ charge of the deprotonated phosphate is actually spread evenly on the four oxygen, and each phosphorus-oxygen bond can be considered have some double bond character (Figure A.13). It is the plethora of electrons on the phosphate molecule that is the basis of the storage and release of energy in the ATP molecule. Figure A.13: Orbital hybridization of Phosphorus for the phosphate molecule, and below the even spread of the π bond. Obtained with permission from https://chem.libretexts.org/ A.5 sp2 hybridization examples A.5.1 Nitrate In the nitrate molecule, the nitrogen atom (SN=3+0=3) loses an electron and becomes N+ and reconfigures its orbitals to have three sp2 and one 2p orbitals, each filled with one electron only. The nitrate molecule is thus a planar molecule. Two of the oxygen atoms gain an electron and effectively become O-. It is unclear at this point whether or not the oxygen atoms themselves reconfigure their orbitals or not… There seems to be conflicting descriptions. Most text books tends to agree that the π bond is not particularly located on one oxygen atom, but rather that each of the σ bond has an additional π like bond. The model proposed in Figure A.14 works, although the resonance among all oxygen atoms is not that straight forward in my opinion. Each of the sp2 orbital of N makes a covalent σ bond with one of the 2p orbitals of each of the oxygen. The two 2p orbitals left on both of N and O atoms form a π bond. Similar to Phosphate, the electrons of the π bond spread evenly on the three oxygen, and each nitrogen-oxygen bond can be considered have some double bond character π bond (Figure A.14). Figure A.14: Orbital hybridization of nitrogen for the nitrate molecule, and the even spread of the π bond A.5.2 Nitrite In the nitrite molecule, the nitrogen atom (SN=2+1=3) does not need to lose an electron and reconfigures its orbitals to have three sp2 and one 2p orbitals, with one sp2 orbital filled with 2 electrons and all other orbitals filled with one electron only. One of the oxygen atoms gains an electron and effectively become O-. The model proposed in Figure A.15 works. Two of the sp2 orbital of N makes a covalent σ bond with one of the 2p orbitals of each of the oxygen. The two 2p orbitals left on both of N and O atoms form a π bond. Similar to nitrate, the electrons of the π bond spread evenly on the two oxygen, and each nitrogen-oxygen bond can be considered have some double bond character π bond (Figure A.15). Figure A.15: Orbital hybridization of nitrogen for the nitrite molecule, and the even spread of the π bond A.6 sp hybridization examples A.6.1 Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the quintessential molecule to illustrate sp hybridization. Carbon dioxide has two double bonds with oxygen, making its steric number to be SN=2+0=2. This suggests that the Carbon orbitals rearrange into 2 sp orbitals. In carbon dioxide, the oxygen atoms also rearrange into sp2 hybrids (Figure A.16), such that the two sp orbitals of the carbon form a σ bond with one of sp2 orbitals available of the oxygen atoms. Then the 2p orbitals left form π bonds together. Because of the configuration of the 2sp2p orbitals, the double bonds are at 90° of each other (Figure A.16). Figure A.16: sp orbital hybridization of carbon for the carbon dioxide molecule, and sp2 orbital hybridization of the oxygen atoms A.6.2 Dinitrogen Dinitrogen (N2) steric number is SN=1+1=2. This suggests that the Nitrogen orbitals rearrange into 2 sp orbitals. The two sp orbitals of the nitrogen form a σ bond together. Two π bonds form as the electrons in the 2p orbitals are shared among the two atoms. This is the reason for the formation of the triple bond in dinitrogen (Figure A.17). This bond is so strong that although there are two lone pairs left on each of the nitrogen atoms, which would make dinitrogen suceptible to lose these electrons, the dinitrogen molecule is mostly inert and unreactive for most metabolic pathways. This is why dinitrogen is referred to as unreactive nitrogen. The triple bond can be broken physically by lightnings, or biologically in very specialized cells such as heterocysts of cyanobacteria, or by symbiotic bacteria living in legumes or (Alnus sp.) root nodules. Figure A.17: sp orbital hybridization of nitrogen for the dinitrogen molecule and formation of the triple bond with two lone pairs left per N atom. The σ bond is formed by direct overlap of the sp orbitals and the the two π bonds by sideways overlap among the 2p orbitals (px and py) A.7 Example of no hybridization A.7.1 Dihydrogen sulfide Interestingly, dihydrogen sulfide (H2S) orbitals do not seem to follow the normal hybridization scheme described above. The steric number for the sulfur is SN=2+2=4, so it would expected that sulfur orbitals would hybridize into sp3 forms. This would then suggest that the angle between the H-S bonds would be around 109° as is the case for the very similar H2O molecule. But measurements suggest that the angle is more like 92°, closer to the 90° angle between the p orbitals (Figure A.18). Figure A.18: Direct overlap of 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms with the 3p orbitals (e.g., py and pz) of the S atom, for a final 92° angle between the H-S σ bonds. Modified from https://www.periodni.com/gallery/formation_of_h2s.png A.8 Lewis dot structures A.8.1 Valence electrons and octet rule Lewis dot structures are representation of the bonds between atoms in molecules and of the lone pairs of electrons that might be left on a particular atom. It is a very powerful tool for us as it allows to allocate the electrons in a molecule (see this Chapter). Several rules have been established to draw Lewis dot structures, which we recall here. Several terms need to be recalled here first. Valence electrons: valence electrons are the electrons that are present in the outer electronic shell of a particular atom. For C, N, and O, valence electrons are the electrons in the 2s2p shell. For S, and P, valence electrons are the electrons in the 3s3p3d outer shell. And for H, the valence electron is the one in the 1s shell. An atom with a closed shell of valence electrons (corresponding to an electron configuration s2p6) tends to be chemically inert. Atoms with one or two more valence electrons than are needed for a “closed” shell are highly reactive due to the following reasons: It requires relatively low energy to remove the extra valence electrons to form a positive ion. Because of their tendency either to gain the missing valence electrons (thereby forming a negative ion), or to share valence electrons (thereby forming a covalent bond) (Wikipedia contributors 2018q). The tendency to gain missing valence electrons to form a closed shell for the CHONSP (8 electrons for CONSP, 2 electrons for H) is called the octet rule, because each bonded atom has eight valence electrons including shared electrons. In their natural state, Hydrogen (H) has 1 valence electron is and is said to be univalent. Carbon (C) has 4 valence electrons, and as a result will tend to have 4 bonds with other atoms in a molecule. There are exceptions such as in carbon monoxide. Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) have 5 valence electrons. N will tend to form three bonds with other atoms in most cases, although it can lose an electron to form 4 bonds like in NH4+, or in N2O, and technically becomes positive. For the vast majority of our cases, P is in the form of phosphate in which P forms four σ bonds and one π bond thanks to the 3d orbital available (see phosphate). Oxygen (O) and sulfur (S) have 6 valence electrons. They will tend to form two bonds in most cases, although they can also gain one electron, become negative, and only have one single bond and a third lone pair of electrons. In the case of the sulfide ion S2-, sulfur gains two electrons and does not bond with any other atom. A.8.2 Building Lewis dot structures Several guidelines are available on chemistry books and tutorials. The one that makes the most sense to me is the technique that consists in drawing each atom with all its valence electrons, and try to build the molecule from this information. Let us take the example of nitrate. Draw all atoms with their valence electrons around them, and put the most electronegative electrons on the outside of the future molecule Draw bonds between two valence electrons for the center and outer atoms. Now, the Nitrogen atom has a lone pair of electrons and three single bonds. As it shares the electrons with oxygen, its outer shell now has eight electrons, so the octet rule is fulfilled. However, each of the oxygen only has 7 electrons so the octet rule is not fulfilled. Since there is a lone pair of electrons on the N, it is possible to share one electron of this lone pair with another electron on one of the oxygen to create a double bond. The octet rule is now fulfilled for the oxygen on the right of the diagram below. It would be tempting to do the same with the left over electron on the Nitrogen to create another double bond with another oxygen. But then, the nitrogen would have five bonds, or the equivalent of 10 shared electrons, and that would go against the octet rule. So this is not a possibility. But now, the octet rule for the Nitrogen is not fulfilled any longer, as it effectively shares 9 electrons… Because oxygen is a lot more electronegative, and nitrogen has this one extra electron left, it can ‘steal’ this electron from the nitrogen, which effectively becomes positive, but regains its octet rule, while the oxygen on the left becomes negative, and has its octet rule fulfilled. The last oxygen now still has 7 electrons total. It needs another one from somewhere. The current molecule is neutral as it N is positive and one O is negative. An extra electron has to come from elsewhere to fulfill the octet rule of the third oxygen, making this oxygen negative as well, and the whole molecule minus one negative. Well, if it is so easy to get an electron ‘from elsewhere’, why not applying this to each oxygen, to begin with like in the diagram below. This would make a NO33- which has all its octet rules fulfilled. To decide we need to introduce the important concept of formal charge. The formal charge (FC) of each atom can be calculated as: FC = (nb of valence electron) - (nb of bonds) - (nb of electrons on lone pairs) In fact, a Lewis dot structure is not complete until the formal charges on each of the atoms are added next to each of the atom. In the end, the most stable/likely molecule is the molecule for which: The formal charge will be as low as possible on each of the atoms, AND, keep the total charge of the molecule as low as possible, AND, have the most electronegative atom have the most negative formal charge. In the previous NO3- vs. NO33-, one cannot conclude among the two molecules just on the formal charges and the electronegativity criteria. However, the molecules being otherwise equal, the lower overall molecular charge of NO3- makes this form possible over the NO33- form. In the sulfate example below, three forms are possible. The octet rule for S is fulfilled for the form on the left, but because sulfur is on the third period, some electrons can be on the 3d orbitals, hence the possibility for more than 8 shared electrons like on the middle and right forms. The formal charges are higher in absolute value for the left form compared to the two others, which makes them preferable. The formal charges on the right form are equivalent to the ones on the middle form. However, in the right form, the formal charge on the lesser electronegative sulfur is lower than those on the oxygens, rendering this form unlikely as well. The probable, preferred form is thus the middle form with two single bonds, two double bonds and two oxygen atoms with a minus one negative charge. This concludes this quick reminder on minimum knowledge applicable to electron orbitals, molecular configurations, and Lewis dot structure. There are many guides and tutorials available on the web and elsewhere to complete this guide, which should be sought to confirm and verify your understanding. Below are some exercises for training purposes.
