I suppose we are never done with a subject which is rather amorphous, as it involves many disciplines, and has many fields of application. Wikipedia (2018m) has some nice definitions of Biogeochemistry, including: In particular, biogeochemistry is the study of the cycles of chemical elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, and their interactions with and incorporation into living things transported through earth scale biological systems in space through time. With the definition above, the study of ancient earth history or of modern acid rains (e.g., Schlesinger 2005) are included in biogeochemistry… The unifying theme is that regardless of the application, the processes involved stay pretty much the same and involve transfer of electrons and protons. Differentiation within biogeochemistry come from the fields of application. The field of application of this book is excess nutrient and sediment loads generated by human activities, their consequences on aquatic ecosystems, and the processes involved to improve and protect groundwater and surface water quality in watersheds. There is a niche in disturbed, nutrient rich, often rural environments, where we perceive there is a need for an integrated and horizontal delivery of knowledge spanning from electron orbitals, biochemistry, cell microbiology, hydrological functioning, process kinetics modeling, and treatment system design. It is possible that readers with strong biological background might find the biological facet of this book a bit short and simple. Just as well, non-engineers should not be afraid of ‘engineering’ in the title. The course is designed to provide the biological knowledge engineers might not have obtained in their curriculae, and the quantitative knowledge non-engineers might not have been exposed to as well. Regardless, I do hope that environmental scientists, ecologists, and engineers alike, will find the integration of knowledge useful in this book. The physical objects used as foundation for this class include naturally occurring and human-designed filters, which may reduce excess nutrient concentrations and loads in rural and suburban environments. Systems reviewed include wetlands, riparian buffers and vegetated filter strips, woodchip bioreactors, streams, stormwater ponds and bioretention zones. This book uses excess nitrogen as the core parameter where the principles of biogeochemical processes are illustrated, and may apply to other fields of application. In summary, this book provides the basic necessary biogeochemical knowledge to answer these questions: How do wetlands, streams, riparian zones, woodchip bioreactors, and other ecologically based treatment systems filter excess nutrient out of the aquatic environment? How can we as a society or as ecological engineers and as environmental scientists use or design treatment systems to filter out excess nutrients? 1.2 Biogeochemical processes in pollution flows This book is intrinsically related to the concept of pollution, the consequences of pollution, and what can be done about it. Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change (Wikipedia contributors 2018p). Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities, leading to degradation of aquatic ecosystems (Wikipedia contributors 2018j) The goals of environmental and ecological engineers and scientists are to reduce pollution, and in our case improve water quality. The concept of water pollution implies that there is a source of contamination, contaminants, and at the end, adverse consequences on aquatic ecosystems, but also on human health. It is interesting to realize that there is almost an infinite number of ‘pathways’ from a pollution source to its consequences. To replace the field of application of the biogeochemical processes described in this book, one can take an example of a pathway from contaminants to consequences to illustrate the knowledge areas this book focuses on. The most spectacular events are usually reported in the press, which has been extremely instrumental in increasing the global awareness at all levels, and in many cases have triggered regulation changes. The most infamous case was when the Cuyahoga River repeatedly catching on fire near Cleveland caught the attention of the Time Magazine in 1969 (Latson 2015), eventually leading to the Clean Water Act in 1972 (Wikipedia contributors 2018o). Newspaper articles relating and explaining the causes and consequences of pollution are remarkable in many ways: they have a way to encapsulate much information, in simple and concise terms. Since most scientists and engineers are pretty good visual learners, a complimentary approach to written articles can be visual objects. Telling the same story in the form of a flow chart translating a two page article in one visual object can be very effective in a class setting. For this, I have created a simple template to derive such ‘pollution flow charts’. A list of symbols illustrating the important steps between the pollution cause(s) to its consequence(s) are proposed in Table 1.1 below. Table 1.1: List of symbols used to construct a pollution flow chart, which can visually describe pollutions from their sources to their consequences Illustrated Symbol shape Symbol shape Description Label shape list of all the Non Point Sources (NPS) and point sources (PS) Rectangle lists all the direct pollutants resulting from the source(s) Diamond vector(s) of the pollutant(s). Often several Rounded rectangle receiving air or water bodies. Often several Disk macroscale consequence(s), often visible Heart lists all the health risks identified Pentagon lists all the identified environmental consequences Equipped with this tool box, it is possible to visually summarize the flow of pollution for most situations. In 2017, an article was written by Lisa W. Foderaro about the causes and consequences of dysfunctional septic tanks in Long Island, NY, USA. It takes the reader between 5 to 10 min to read the article. I let the reader do just that here. ‘Dead Rivers, Closed Beaches’: A Water Crisis on Long Island By LISA W. FODERARO MAY 8, 2017 OAKDALE, N.Y. — The Great South Bay, flanked by Fire Island and the South Shore of Long Island, once produced half the shellfish consumed in the United States, and supported 6,000 jobs in the early 1970s. Since then, the health of the bay has declined. Housing development meant more septic tanks depositing more nitrogen in the ground. The nitrogen flowed to rivers and the Great South Bay, leading to algae blooms. It depleted salt marshes that serve as fish habitat and suppressed oxygen levels. One result is that the shellfish industry has all but collapsed. The annual harvest of hard clams, for example, has fallen more than 90 percent since 1980. After sweeping legislation that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed in April, Suffolk County and other local governments in New York are hoping to deal with their aging — or absent — sewer lines, drinking water systems and other water infrastructure. The law, the Clean Water Infrastructure Act, allocates $2.5 billion to a variety of projects, as concerns about the safety of drinking water are growing. Across the United States, impressive gains in water quality were made in the decades after passage of the Clean Water Act of 1972. But courts have generally ruled that the federal law was designed to address surface water contamination, and are divided about its application to tainted groundwater. As a result, problems from industrial pollution and untreated sewage have persisted. The water quality problem is acute in Suffolk County. With 360,000 septic systems, Suffolk has roughly the same number as all of New Jersey. For years, nitrogen from leaky septic tanks has seeped into groundwater and eventually into rivers and bays. “What we have been doing for decades is just managing the decline of water quality,” said Steven Bellone, the Suffolk County executive. “Every water body is listed as impaired. We have dead rivers, closed beaches, harmful algal blooms. Before signing the law on Long Island in late April, Mr. Cuomo noted that a quarter of New York’s 610 sewage treatment plants were operating past their useful life. “We’re living off the legacy not of our parents but of our grandparents,” he said. The new state act, which spans five years, will among other things provide $1.5 billion in grants for water infrastructure improvements, $75 million in rebates to help homeowners replace septic systems and $110 million to protect land in watersheds. The money significantly expands a similar state infrastructure fund that over the last few years made $400 million available to communities. In addition to the new water infrastructure financing, the state budget allotted $40 million to build two sewer systems in business districts on the North Shore in Suffolk County. And there was $5 million for Suffolk County and the Center for Clean Water Technology at Stony Brook University to develop new methods of removing contaminants from drinking water. While it was one of the more significant investments to emerge from the state budget, some say it should be viewed as a down payment. Steve Englebright, a state assemblyman who heads the Environmental Conservation Committee, has said $80 billion to $100 billion is required to address the state’s aging water infrastructure. On Long Island, which is already grappling with hazardous waste at scores of active Superfund sites, the geology poses special challenges. With scant wastewater treatment, Suffolk County sits atop an aquifer that provides virtually all of its drinking water, and the sandy soil allows nitrogen to seep into it. Nassau County, just west of Suffolk, has many more homes using sewers than Suffolk, where 75 percent of the population relies on septic systems. The main reason that a county as populous as Suffolk has remained on septic systems, county officials say, is the legacy of the last attempt at installing a system — the infamous Southwest Sewer District. The sewer system, covering parts of the towns of Islip and Babylon, was eventually built. But the project, which started coming on line in 1981, became so mired in corruption, delays and cost overruns that it spooked future elected officials. “It was the biggest scandal in the county’s history,” Mr. Bellone said. “The appetite politically to do anything on this issue was nonexistent after that. It effectively killed sewering here for decades.” Suffolk County is eager to catch up to Nassau on wastewater treatment, but officials say new sewer systems are prohibitively expensive. One project on the drawing board, for instance, will cover about 8,200 parcels bordering four rivers that feed into the Great South Bay. The price tag is $383 million. Instead, the county’s strategy is to coax homeowners to replace antiquated septic tanks with high-tech “denitrification systems” — small units that cost more than older septic systems but remove most of the nitrogen from wastewater. Mr. Bellone said Suffolk hoped to tap the new state fund to help property owners acquire the systems. The same article can be summarized very efficiently in a pollution flow chart illustrated in Figure 1.1. The causes of this pollution are leaky and dysfunctional septic tanks. The results are that untreated nitrogen finds its way through the groundwater (GW), which is the vector in this article. The article mentions two receiving bodies: the bay and the aquifer. There are potential health risks associated with too much nitrogen added in the aquifer which serves as a drinking water supply (e.g., drinking water limit in the US for nitrate is 10 mg N/L). The article particularly insists on the fact that much of the excess nitrogen finds its way to rivers and end up in the Great South Bay, where algal blooms form. The consequences of the algal blooms are all linked to the depletion of oxygen generated from the large amount of organic matter decaying in the bay. Figure 1.1: Pollution flow chart for the article ‘Dead Rivers, Closed Beaches’: A Water Crisis on Long Island, published in the New York Times, in May 2017 This book aims at providing enough details about the important steps of this and other pollution flow charts. In particular, this book aims at providing the necessary knowledge for environmental scientists and engineers to be able to describe with confidence the processes and the actors at play in a generic pollution chart. As such this book addresses the conditions that lead to algal blooms, and provides enough phycology knowledge to describe the major bloom forming groups. The book particularly insists on the biogeochemical processes associated with eutrophication, which are very close to the ones at play in treatment systems naturally existing or man-designed to reduce pollutant loads closest to their source (Figure 1.2) Figure 1.2: Target areas and processes for this class in the pollution flow chart for the article ‘Dead Rivers, Closed Beaches’: A Water Crisis on Long Island 1.3 Scope of this book The scope of this book is to provide an ‘horizontal’ view across disciplines going from electron orbitals to removal efficacies at the treatment scale. For this, this book reviews and puts together into one ensemble the necessary knowledge from desciplines including chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, thermochemistry, modeling, and ecological engineering. The book first reviews the electron allocations on atoms and molecule, which are at the source of the generation and storage of energy in the biosphere. The book provides the necessary thermochemistry knowledge by introducing the notions of pH and pε and teaches how to draw pH-pε diagrams. The book presents the functioning of several treatment systems, and uses wetlands as a teaching model where most of the biogeochemical processes important in ecological engineering are present. The book presents process kinetics and models often applied in ecological engineering. 1.4 Exercises The goal of the exercises below is to draw pollution flow charts from articles published in the press and to realize that there always are at least a contaminant source, a vector, a receiving body, and environmental and health consequences. Not all elements are necessarily reported in all press articles, but they generally are. Good luck! Florida Red Tide: Wildlife Advocate Stunned by Toll on Fish By The Associated Press Aug. 22, 2018 ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — The head of one of the U.S.’s largest environmental nonprofits says he was stunned Wednesday to see thousands of dead fish and devastation to other marine life from a red tide off hugging southwest Florida’s Gulf Coast. Collin O’Mara, the president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, went on Wednesday with a charter boat captain in waters off Southwest Florida coast in the Sanibel Island area. He reported thousands and thousands of dead fish, eels and horseshoe crabs in the Gulf of Mexico. He also saw the carcasses of six-foot-long Goliath grouper fish. “I was astounded by the level of carnage that we saw,” said O’Mara. “Of all the disasters I’ve seen in the past decade, this is probably the most visual.” The toxic algae bloom has overrun Florida’s southern Gulf Coast this summer. It’s hugging much of Florida’s peninsula, from Naples in the south to Bradenton some 150 miles north. Red tide is a natural occurrence that happens due to the presence of nutrients in salt water and an organism called a dinoflagellate. This bloom started in November. The last toxic bloom in the Gulf happened between 2004-2006. The algae bloom can cause breathing problems in some people, and because of the smell left behind by the dead fish, has cleared vacationers from some tourist areas. But the main impact has been on the wildlife, and experts are concerned. “It was actually pretty overwhelming being there,” said O’Mara, who also toured another part of the state on Wednesday to look at a different algae crisis. He visited areas affected by blue-green algae, which is in freshwater. Heavy May rains caused Lake Okeechobee to discharge water containing blue-green algae into rivers and canals. The bright green sludge oozed onto docks, dams and rivers. People often get the two algae confused, because they’re occurring simultaneously, and in some cases, in the same county. The red tide algae in the Gulf has killed at least 452 sea turtles, nearly 100 manatees, 11 dolphins and tons of fish. County maintenance crews have had to use backhoes to scoop up all the dead marine life on the beaches. Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in seven counties along Florida’s Gulf that have been overrun by the pungent bloom. He also ordered $1.5 million to be spent on various clean-up efforts and to help business impacted by dwindling tourists. By The Editorial Board Oct. 25, 2016 North Carolina’s Noxious Pig Farms The landscape of eastern North Carolina is dotted with giant pools of bright pink sludge. These are waste lagoons, where industrial farms across the state dispose of billions of gallons of untreated pig urine and feces every year. The waste can carry E. coli, salmonella, cryptosporidium and other bacteria that can lead to serious illness or death if they spread to humans. After Hurricane Matthew deluged North Carolina this month, at least 14 of the lagoons flooded. Environmental advocates and state officials have been flying over regions to identify overflowing lagoons where floodwaters have become mixed with the waste, a public health hazard that could last for weeks as bacteria flow into rivers and streams, potentially sickening those who come into contact with those waters. Bacteria can also contaminate groundwater, the main source of drinking water for more than three million North Carolinians. Meanwhile, the nitrogen and phosphorus in hog waste can kill fish and damage ecosystems. State officials are now beginning to test rivers to assess the level of contamination. In states where hog farmers use waste lagoons, like North Carolina and Illinois, flooding is a serious hazard that may become more frequent as climate change leads to more severe storms. Even under normal conditions, lagoons can produce dangerous gases, noxious smells and dust containing hog waste. People living near these lagoons are at increased risk of asthma, diarrhea, eye irritation, depression and other health problems. A research program at North Carolina State University has found several safer waste-disposal methods, including one that converts nitrogen in waste into harmless nitrogen gas and uses another process to eliminate harmful bacteria. North Carolina took steps toward protecting its residents by passing a moratorium on new lagoons in 1997 and making it permanent in 2007. But around 4,000 lagoons constructed before 1997 remain in active use. Unless North Carolina and other states require agriculture companies to change their waste-disposal methods, what happened after Hurricane Matthew will happen again. References "],

We have also seen that these three challenges are inter-connected and related. Nutrients and organic matter are related because the former contain the needed atoms necessary to build living cell and organism structures, corresponding to living organic matter, while the latter generally refers to dead organic matter and/or the assemblage of molecules which at one point were part of a living organism. This definition of the linkage between the two is hardly satisfying, however… When one looks at where the electrons are allocated on the important atoms, a much more unifying scheme appears. This chapter describes this unifying scheme. 2.1 The five fundamental requirements of life Before we dive down to the electron level, let us make sure we recognize that it is possible to simplify why there is, or not, life on our planet and the universe. Such a list includes: the presence of liquid water available nutrients that can fulfill the need for the six most numerous and important atoms that build most of our cell and organism structure: C, H, O, N, S, P. Without the commas comes this delightful acronym CHONSP which generations of students have come to love a source of energy, which in most cases is the form of solar or chemical energy electrons acceptor(s), without which chemical energy cannot be released and a suitable temperature range (about -5°C to +50°C) because of course most of living organisms will not live for very long outside this range There are many other requirements for life to occur, e.g., the ability to reproduce or even to die, but for what we are interested, this is a satisfying list. In this chapter, we will address the source of energy and what secret living organisms have found to store energy. Primary producers, which include most of chlorophyll containing plants from algae to angiosperms (flowering plants), have the ability to use solar radiations as a source of energy. An entire chapter is dedicated to this marvel. However, even for primary producers, solar radiations cannot be the sole source of energy, otherwise they would die at night… And for the rest of living organisms, solar radiations are just not a source of energy (merely a source of ‘bien-être’ or vitamin D for humans…!). So obviously, life has had to find a solution so that energy would be available for all conditions of light and temperature on earth. The first secret of life is the ability to store energy in the form of high energy electrons onto organic molecules. Having a source of energy is always a good thing. However, energy can only be released if there is an outlet for it, otherwise it stays as potential energy. Practically, this means that the energy stored on organic molecules can and is only released when the electrons go from the high potential to a lower one, or in others words from electron donors (most of the time from organic molecules) to electron acceptors. This is the second secret of life on earth: on our planet exists this miracle molecule, O2, which acts as an extremely powerful electron acceptor. So you have to imagine O2 less as a gentle acceptor of electrons that organic matter would be kind enough to donate, but more like a very aggressive electron seeker and any organic matter located close to oxygen runs the risk to be oxidized, that is to lose its electrons. Sometimes, I like to refer to O2 as the electron kleptomaniac. So in oxygenated environments such as earth’s atmosphere and most water bodies, living organisms’ only concern is to have potential energy available in the form of high energy electrons stored onto organic molecules, because this energy can easily be released at any time thanks to the very oxidizing agent O2. Chapter ?? goes into the details of how this energy is released and transferred in cells. 2.2 Electron allocation onto CHONSP First, among the 6 atoms that form CHONSP, and this is true for all atoms except for noble gases which are stable monatomic atoms, none of them exist as monatomic atoms: they always form bonds with other atoms to form molecules. Among the CHONSP, three of them are homonuclear diatomic molecules, i.e., they can form molecules of two atoms of the same chemical element: H2 (dihydrogen, although it is most often referred to simply as hydrogen, which can be quite confusing), O2 (dioxygen, although oxygen is also most often used, unfortunately), and N2 (dinitrogen, which name is generally properly applied). Obviously, they can also bind to other elements, which is what we are about to see. If indeed, on our planet floats a very oxidizing agent in the form of O2, then the stable state of all other molecules should be where most other elements have lost all their electrons to oxygen. And there ought to be techniques to see where the electrons are allocated on molecules. 2.3 Electronegativity as a powerful tool to allocate electrons Chemists have created the oxidation state (OS) or oxidation number indicator which quantifies this electron allocation to some extent, but we find it to be rather confusing for our purpose of allocating or view where the electrons are Stored in molecules. More discussion and information on Oxidation State is available in the glossary of this book. We must first lock in the electronegativity concept. Electronegativity is a chemical property which describes how well an atom can attract an electron to itself. In the periodic table in Figure 2.1, first observe that our CHONSP all belong to the non-metallic atoms. Figure 2.1: Vibrant Periodic Table With 118 Elements. Obtained freely from https://sciencenotes.org/periodic-table-pdf-2/ Second, all atoms are more or less electronegative. The most electronegative atom is F, fluorine. Electronegativity decreases towards the left and the bottom of the table as illustrated in Figure 2.2. For our CHONSP, ElecNegO &gt; ElecNegN &gt; ElecNegS &gt; ElecNegC &gt; ElecNegH &gt; ElecNegP. Figure 2.2: Periodic table of the elements with electronegativities shown. Obtained freely from https://sciencenotes.org/list-of-electronegativity-values-of-the-elements/ If you look carefully in Figure 2.2 and in equation (2.1), you will see that the electronegativity of oxygen is 3.44, which is a lot greater than that of N (3.04), and the difference between N and C and S, is about 0.5. In other words, all the CHNSP stand no chance next to O: in any molecule which may involve CHNSP, the O atom will attract the electrons for itself. \\[\\begin{align} O \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; N \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; S \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; C \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; H \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; P \\\\ 3.44 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 3.05 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.58 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.56 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.30 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.19 \\tag{2.1} \\end{align}\\] For example, in the H2O molecule, one can see in the Lewis dot Structure below that by applying the electronegativity rule, the O atom has all the electrons for itself, while the 2 H, have none for themselves. Let us make sure that there is no confusion between the octet rule and the electronegativity. Atoms assemble into molecules so that their octet rules be fulfilled. So in the H2O molecule, yes each H shares an electron with the O and reciprocally. But, the electronegativity tells us which atom really has the electrons for itself. And that atom is O. Figure 2.3: Electron allocation on the water molecule following the electronegativity rule We realize that the electron allocation can be quite confusing or a bit artificial at first, but we shall see in Chapter ?? that it is fully corroborated with oxidation and reduction processes. You can now see in equation (2.1), that sulfur and carbon nearly have the same electronegativity, which is one of the reasons for the ease of formation of the disulfur bridges in proteins. Also notice that phosphorus has the lowest electronegativity of our CHONSP, and this is the reason why, as we shall see later, phosphorus stays in the oxidized form, even in organic molecules. 2.4 Dioxygen: the ‘electron kleptomaniac’ molecule Oxygen is a homonuclear diatomic molecules, which means that it can form the diatomic molecule O2. The two atoms of Oxygen, having the same electronegativity, split the electrons, which means that each atom has 6 electrons for itself as shown in Figure 2.4. So if we summarize things, we have the most electronegative atom in the universe after Fluorine (Figure 2.2) that is floating in most places on earth and in water essentially in a state (O2) where it really would rather have 8 rather than 6 electron for itself! This is the reason why oxygen is the ultimate electron acceptor, although a better representation might be to describe it as the ultimate ‘electron kleptomaniac’. Figure 2.4: Electron allocation on the water molecule following the electronegativity rule But let us be clear: the oxygen atom can only be an electron acceptor if it does not have 8 electrons for itself. The only two possibilities are in the case of O2, for which each atom as 6 electrons for itself, and the other possibility is for hydrogen peroxide \\(H-O-O-H\\), where each oxygen atom have 7 electrons for themselves. Because oxygen is the most electronegative atom (after fluorine), in all other molecules where it is involved, oxygen will have 8 electrons for itself, and can therefore never accept more electrons. 2.5 Fully Oxidized forms of CNSP On our planet, we have the luxury to ‘bath’ in an oxidized environment, which means among other things, that the oxygen atom will tend to attract all the electrons for itself when involved with CHNSP. Another way to look at it is to say that the stable state in an aerobic environment of the CHNSP atoms corresponds to molecules where the CHNSP atoms will have zero electrons for themselves. Well, and guess what, there are not that many possibilities, in fact only one for each of the CNSP atoms! In Figure 2.5 below, you can see that none of the CNSP atoms have electrons for themselves: they have all been taken by the oxygen atoms! Figure 2.5: Electron allocation on each of the C, N, S, and P atoms for the CO2, nitrate, sulfate, and phosphate molecules, showing that C, N, S, and P atoms have no electrons for themselves, or are fully oxidized, while Oxygen has 8, or is fully reduced As a result, these molecules are deemed as stable in an aerobic environment. This suggests that all other molecules containing CNSP are essentially unstable on our planet…?! Yes, you read it correctly, that is the case! Honestly, there is nothing new really as this has been written a long time ago, e.g., in the Christian Bible “you are dust and to dust you will return” (Gn 3:19). So we essentially have a reprieve on this planet, but so do all living creatures!! The secret of life has been to be able to create and maintain CNSP atoms with electron for themselves, very well ‘knowing’ that these electrons would eventually be stripped away by O2, but living organisms take advantage of this because the transfer of electrons generates energy (see Chapter ??). Notice that the suffix of the oxidized forms of N, S, and P, is -ate. The exception appears to be CO2, which is a gas while the -ate molecules are dissolved ions. However, the ionic forms of dissolved CO2 are bicarbonate and carbonate, which suffix is -ate. So everything is logical in the end. To be complete, all the fully oxidized forms of CNSP, may lose of gain protons H+ depending on the pH. It turns out that for the pH range encountered in most natural waters (3.5 &lt; pH &lt; 9), only the carbonates and the phosphates may have different molecular formulae. So the fully oxidized forms of C in inorganic molecules are illustrated in Figure 2.6 below (aditional details available in the glossary): Figure 2.6: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of C, including from left to right CO2, carbonic acid, hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate), and carbonate, showing that the C atoms have no electrons for themselves The fully oxidized forms of P in inorganic molecules are illustrated in Figure 2.7 below (aditional details available in the glossary): Figure 2.7: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of P, including from left to right Phosphoric acid, dihydrogen Phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, and phosphate , showing that the P atoms have no electrons for themselves 2.6 Oxidation versus Reduction But if O2 wants electrons so badly from any atom, how come all living creature do not just turn into ‘dust’, i.e., carbon dioxide, nitrate, sulfate and phosphate, all the time and manage to live at all?? A minimum ‘energy obstacle’ must be overcome for electrons to be transferred: this is referred to as the activation energy (see Chapter ??). This obstacle is overcome during combustion: the high temperature of a flame self propagates the transfer of electrons from organic matter to O2. Chapter ?? provides in great details how living organisms manage to allow enough transfer of electrons to generate energy, without turning into ‘dust’ at once like in combustion. Yet, when an organism dies, all the electrons stored onto the organic molecules are eventually taken by oxygen in an aerobic environment. We have now established that oxygen eventually takes all electrons, but for that to happen, a minimum energy obstable must be overcome. This opens the possibility for CNSP to, at least temporarily, have electrons for themselves. This also opens the possibility to an infinite number of possible combinations of CHONSP assemblages in nature. Before we get there though, it is time to establish some important terms. The fact that the oxygen atom tends to strip all electrons for itself is referred to as oxidation. This terms comes from the early days of chemistry referring to reactions where oxygen was involved. We now know that oxygen is not necessarily the only one involved in loss of electrons. By extention, any atom which loses electrons, not necessarily to O2, is said to be oxidized. Reversely, an atom which gains electrons is said to be reduced or to undergo reduction. This term also comes from the early days of chemistry when Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794) observed that the weight of a heated metallic ore diminished due to the loss of dioxygen as a gas; and the metallic ore appeared reduced in size and in weight (Wikipedia contributors 2018f). We now know that this corresponds to the acquisition of electrons, hence the word reduction for the gain of electrons. Several mnemonics exist in English to associate electron loss/gain with oxidation/reduction: LEO (Loss of Electrons is Oxidation) the lion says GER (Gain of Electrons is Reduction)! OIL RIG: Oxidation Is Loss (of electrons) Reduction Is Gain (of electrons) When oxygen takes electrons from another atom, we say that oxygen has been reduced, while the other atom has been oxidized. An oxidation is necessarily accompanied with a reduction, as electrons do not ‘float’ in solution like protons do. When the CNSP atoms have lost all their electrons like in Figure 2.5, we say that the CNSP atoms are fully oxidized. Fully reduced atoms have 8 electrons for themselves, as is the case for oxygen in carbon dioxide (and carbonates), nitrate, sulfate, and phosphates. This suggests that between fully oxidized and fully reduced, there might be cases where atoms are partially oxidized and reduced. 2.7 A gradient of oxidation and reduction states on inorganic and organic molecules Indeed, whether CNSP atoms have 1, 2, etc. to 8 electrons for themselves, they will form very different molecules. It is now time to define what organic vs. inorganic molecules are. The term organic molecule finds its roots in vitalism, where it was believed that the elements entering in the composition of living organisms had to be different to the ones that made inanimate things. The term organic has remained and a more modern definition is that an organic molecule is a molecule where there is at least one \\(C-C\\) bond. The best definition of an inorganic molecule is a molecule that is not organic. One of the most important things to understand and learn in this part is that it is the electron allocation which essentially defines what a molecule will be. For example, molecules such as carbon dioxide CO2 and methane CH4 are quite different, one involves oxygen, the other hydrogen atoms. But in reality, one can make sense of the difference by looking at how many electrons the C has for itself. When C has zero electrons for itself, this means that some other electrons have stolen all the electrons from C, and there are not that many possibilities out there. The obvious solution is O=C=O or CO2 and the carbonates (Figure 2.6). For the record, there are at least two other inorganic molecules that exist out there for which C has zero electrons for itself, but they are, relatively, in minuscule quantities : cyanate (N≡C-O-) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). So it is fair to say the ‘only’ molecules with zero electrons is CO2 and carbonates for environmental and ecological applications. Reversely, the only molecule with 8 electrons for itself is a molecule where all the other atoms bound to the C atom give their electrons away. The only atom that will do this is hydrogen, so the only possible molecule with a C atom is methane CH4. In other words, it is quite interesting to look at molecules from the stand point of the number of electrons atoms have for themselves, and conclude on the different possibilities of molecules. Obviously, the examples of CO2 and CH4 are simplistic because they are simple inorganic molecules. Two other simple examples but that matter very much in our field, are nitrate vs. ammonium, and sulfate vs. sulfide. S and N in Sulfate and nitrate having no electron for themselves, the obvious electron ‘stealer’ is oxygen, hence the NO3- and SO42- formulae. In NH4+ and H2S, the S and N have 8 electrons from themselves (Table 2.1) and naturally, hydrogen atoms are providing electrons. Overall, across organic and inorganic moelecules, there is an entire gradient of oxidation states or number of electrons allocated on the C, N, and S (Table 2.1). Notice that I purposely ommitted to mention P here, because the only form of P relevant for environmental and ecological engineering are the phosphates. And we have seen that in the phosphate molecules, P always has zero electrons for itself. It is therefore always in an oxidized form (Figure 2.7). Table 2.1 summarizes a gradient of electron allocations, or a gradient of oxidation and reduction states, on the CNSP atoms. It is important to notice several things: Carbon is the only atom with a variable number of electrons in organic molecules N, and S, always have 8 electrons for themselves in organic molecules This suggests that carbon is quite a variable of adjustment for electron ‘acquisition’ and ‘donation’ This is why C is the atom on which photosynthesis can store, as the first step, electrons, and not any other atom Because C can adjust so easily, reversely, N and S, although in a fully reduced state in organic molecule, will just not give their electrons in an environment where C can do that for them first. As a result, and this is crucial for our field, the byproduct of the oxidation of organic matter in respiration (details in Chapter ??) are reduced and are NH4+ and H2S, as they do not get oxidized during heterotrophic respiration. Notice that only in inorganic molecules, do the N and S, have variable oxidation states, or number of allocated electrons on them. Nitrite has two electrons for itself, and is highly unstable in aerobic environments, as oxygen will try to steal its electrons. Sulfur dioxide and sulfite also are in very small quantities in the atmosphere (SO2) or in water as HSO3- (not represented in Table 2.1) and SO32-, as both will readily be oxidated in sulfuric acid and sulfate. Notice that N2 has 5 electrons for itself, which is quite a lot and, therefore, potentially is an important electron donor. However, the triple bond N≡N is very difficult to break and O2 does not, even at high temperatures. As a result, N≡N is an inert or unreactive gas, although it makes for about 78% of earth’s atmosphere. Nitrogen in N2 is thus referred to as unreactive nitrogen.

Let us take the example of glucose. Glucose is the result molecule of photosynthesis, where electrons have been stored onto the carbon atoms, which originally contained none as the nutrient from which glucose molecule is assembled is CO2. How can one see this? In the equation (2.2)! Additional details on redox half-reactions are provided in the glossary. What is important to see here is that: 24 electrons are necessary to built glucose from CO2 that these 24 electrons originally come from the oxygen atom of H2O that as oxygen atoms from water lose electrons, they form O2, where each atom has only 6 electrons for itself (Figure 2.4) \\[\\begin{align} 6\\,CO_2 + 24\\,H^+ + 24\\,e^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\\,H_2O\\\\ 12\\,H_2O &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; 6\\,O_2 + 24\\,H^+ + 24\\,e^-\\\\ &amp; &amp;\\\\ \\hline\\\\ 6\\,CO_2 + 6\\,H_2O &amp; \\to &amp; C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\\,O_2 \\tag{2.2} \\end{align}\\] After what we have said about oxygen and its prepensity to steal all electrons, why would it suddenly give electrons to C to form glucose? Indeed, there is some magic involved and it is called photosynthesis! For this to happen, magic catalysts able to steal the electrons from oxygen of H2O, and a lot of energy captured in the form of light are necessary! And indeed in the end, thanks to the electron allocation concept, it is possible to visualize onto the glucose molecule where the electrons are as illustrated in Figure 2.8. Figure 2.8: Electron allocation on the glucose molecule showing that the C atoms have 3 to 5, and an average of 4 electrons for themselves So, hopefully you are now convinced thanks to both the equations and Figure 2.8 that indeed electrons are stored onto organic molecules! Notice that four of the C atoms have 4 electrons for themselves, while one has 3 and the last one has 5. On average though, each atom has 4. This actually is quite interesting as it corresponds to the number of electrons C has on its free form. This means that photosynthesis is not ‘trying’ to store more electrons than what it has in its free form: this is probably a lot more efficient than if it tried to store 6 like for the lipids (see Table 2.1 and Chapter 3), and yet provides an opportunity to store a lot of electrons. Let us take another example with cysteine, which also has N and S atoms in it. You can see in Figure 2.9 that the N and S atoms have 8 electrons for themselves, while the C atoms have 1, 4 and 5 electron for themselves. Cysteine has thus stored a total of 28 electrons for a total of 5 CNS atoms or 40% more electrons per atom than glucose. Figure 2.9: Electron allocation on the cysteine molecule showing the number of electrons stored on the C, N and S atoms For an alga who would use nitrate, sulfate and bicarbonates as its nutrients and which would need to anabolize cysteine, it would require to find 28 electrons and energy to assemble cysteine, as no electrons come with the nutrients listed here. Interestingly, the electrons stored on N and S are not useful as a source of electrons in the respiration chain of heterotrophic respiration. But the N and S atoms, which respectively appear as amine (-NH2) and thiol (-SH) radicals for cysteine in Figure 2.9 play a central role in the formation and information molecules which contain N and S have for the cell. This is what the next chapter is going to show. The last example is ATP (Adenosine TriPhosphate), illustrated in Figure 2.10. You can see that there are lots of red dots on the triphosphate side of the molecule, and see that phosphorus has zero electrons for itself…! Chapter ?? details the reasons how and why ATP carries energy. But here, one can see that surely, it is not thanks to electrons on P, since there are none! The triphosphate chain is bound to a ribose, itself bound to an adenine. Ribose + Adenine is called adenosine. On ribose, each carbon stores an average of 4 electrons like all carbohydrates. There are lots of electrons stored on the 5 atoms of nitrogen on adenine. But these are not used for generating energy in the respiration chain. The large number of N atoms and electrons seem to be associated with highly valued molecules as ATP certainly is. Figure 2.10: Electron allocation on the ATP molecule showing the number of electrons stored on the C, N, and P atoms Last but important point. It is possible that some of you are still wondering why the electrons on oxygen are not counted as the number of electrons stored on molecules, and particularly on organic molecules. Oxygen, outside of the O2 molecule, really ‘steals’ electrons from all other atoms, as we have now repeated quite a few times. So when these molecules are anabolized from molecules such as carbonate, nitrate, sulfate or phosphate, each oxygen atom is already loaded with 8 electrons. So, it cannot accept any additional ones. So each oxygen atom in organic and inorganic molecule, is not bringing any electron ‘to the table’. The only changes can occur on the C, N, and S atoms. 2.9 Summary on electron allocations This concludes the chapter on electron allocation, and the first introduction to oxidation and reduction. We have learned that using the electron allocation rooted in the electronegativitiy concept, it is possible to visualize where the electrons are stored and realize that in the vast majority of the time: oxygen steal all electrons for itself and is fully reduced, unless it is in the form of O2, where it become very ‘hungry’ for electrons hydrogen being less electronegative, always gives its electron to CONS atoms Life’s secret to storing energy boils down to having high energy electrons stored on C, N, and S atoms, although only the C atoms are the ones that easily accept or donate electrons. Phosphorus almost always remains as in the fully oxidized forms of phosphates (or polyphosphates), even when incorporated in organic molecules as we shall see in the next chapter. This is due to the fact that phosphorus’ electronegativity is lower than that of hydrogen. Phosphate plays a crucial role in energy conveyance, however, thanks to the pyrophosphate bond. The next step consists in presenting where and why organisms need N, S, and P, to build their structure. The next chapter presents the four molecular families with which all organisms, and therefore organic matter, are assembled. References "],

In fact they thought that the elements at the basis of the animated vs. inanimate things had to be different. One can only wonder at the incredible diversity and complexity of forms between a bacterium and humans, and between unicellular algae and sequoia trees! And yet, despite the incredible variations of life forms and sizes, there is a common theme: very complex organic molecules are polymers of relatively simple monomers. In the image of a brick wall and the skyscraper in Figure 3.1, it is possible to make a small wall or a huge skyscraper. Brick walls are made of bricks and of mortar to hold the bricks together. If one adds metal pieces, wood, etc. the complexity of the final product can be infinite, yet it is made from simple elementary pieces. Figure 3.1: Small and large structures can be built from the addition of bricks, one at a time Living organisms are essentially made of very complex polymers, but which are all built from simple monomers. Just like in a building which complexity results from the assemblage of different types of material, e.g., bricks, wood, metal, etc., living organisms are assembled from distinct ‘types of molecules’. Among the very complex organic polymers, one can distinguish four molecular families (in addition to what we refer to as co-enzymes), where in each family, there is a repeated pattern. A molecular family can be defined as polymers of similar monomers within a family but distinct between families a mortar or chemical bonds which binds monomers together The four molecular families that make organic molecules include: Carbohydrates Proteins Nucleic acids Lipids 3.2 Carbohydrates Carbohydrates form the entry molecules onto which electrons are first stored in photosynthesis, and precisely on the carbon atoms. The generic formula for carbohydrates is (CH2O)n, and each atom, on average, has 4 electrons for itself as illustrated in Figure 3.2. We have seen in the previous chapter that having 4 electrons stored on each C is probably the most cost effective way to store many electrons on organic molecules. Figure 3.2: Electron allocation of a generic carbohydrate (CH2O)n 3.2.1 Monosaccharides The monomers of carbohydrates are called monosaccharides (from Greek monos, i.e., single, and sacchar, sugar) or sometimes called simple sugars or oses (from the Latin “full of, abounding in, having qualities of”). The monomers that are assembled into complex polymers generally are hexoses, that is that they have 6 carbons, and are isomers of glucose. However, monosaccharides do include more than just hexoses or C6H12O6, and it is important to present them in general, and not just the monomers of polysaccharides. Most monosaccharides are made of 3 to 6 carbons (there actually are C7 to C9 oses) and are classified in aldoses or ketoses, depending on whether they have a aldehyde (-CHO) on their C#1 or a ketone (C=O) radical, usually on the carbon numbered #2. They either exist in linear chains and are then represented in Fischer projection like in Figures 3.3 and 3.4, or, for pentoses (C5) and hexoses (C6), exist in cyclic chains (Figures 3.6 and 3.5). Carbohydrates have been given a lot of codes and naming conventions and it is hard to avoid them if we want to put things together. So, do not be scared by all the names and letters used to describe and differentiate carbohydrates. The goal is: to realize the large diversity of monosaccharides to realize that the differences between, e.g., the hexoses are of steric consideration, i.e., which side are the hydroxyl (-OH) groups are of the linear chain, right or left. to realize that C5 and C6 carbohydrates alternate between chain and cyclic molecular configurations. The cyclic form prevails for the functions of transport and structure that the carbohydrates provide. The chain form is the form needed for the release of electrons and energy. Both forms interchange freely for monosaccharides. Figure 3.3: classification of C3 to C6 aldoses in Fischer projection. Triose : (1) D-(+)-glyceraldehyde ; Tetroses : (2a) D-(−)-erythrose ; (2b) D-(−)-threose ; Pentoses : (3a) D-(−)-ribose ; (3b) D-(−)-arabinose ; (3c) D-(+)-xylose ; (3d) D-(−)-lyxose ; Hexoses : (4a) D-(+)-allose ; (4b) D-(+)-altrose ; (4c) D-(+)-glucose ; (4d) D-(+)-mannose ; (4e) D-(−)-gulose ; (4f) D-(−)-idose ; (4g) D-(+)-galactose ; (4h) D-(+)-talose. after Yikrazuul — personal work, public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4030124 Time to incorporate some jargon. When in the chain form necessary for the carbons to donate their electrons, monosaccharides are called reducing sugars. This means that they are able to donate their electrons, to drive respiration and the generation of energy in the cell (details in Chapter ??). So, despite the fact that each carbon atom on monosaccharides has 4 electrons to give, potentially, this does not systematically happen. Strange, is it not? Indeed, for the pentoses and hexoses to be reducing sugars, they must be in the aldose form, or have a free aldehyde at the end of their chain or on carbon #1. So this rules out the ketoses? Actually no, the ketoses in the chain form can be readily tautomerized into aldoses. This is only important to explain some of the differences in disaccharides. Figure 3.4: classification of C3 to C6 ketoses in Fischer projection. Triose : (1) dihydroxyacetone ; Tetrose : (2) D-erythrulose ; Pentoses : (3a) D-ribulose ; (3b) D-xylulose ; Hexoses : (4a) D-psicose ; (4b) D-fructose ; (4c) D-sorbose ; (4d) D-tagatose. after Yikrazuul — personal work, public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6603584 You might wonder what the D-(+) or D-(-) might mean in the legends of Figures 3.3 and 3.4… This is due to optical rotation properties that a pure solution of a particular ose has because of the asymmetry of the molecules. The different forms of hexoses in, e.g., Figure 3.3 are called eniantiomers. D means that the hydroxyl group on the C#n-1 to the right of the molecule and most natural oses tend to be D (few oses have it on the left, in which case they are coded as L). The (+) or (-) tell whether the light rotation is pulled towards positive or negative angles. OK, lots of terms here, mostly to quench some of the curiosity of the biochemist in you. Now that we have a more holistic view of what monosaccharides are made of, for all our purposes, we will reduce all this great variability to a few of them, which are glyceraldehyde (C3), ribose and deoxyribose (C5), and, glucose and fructose (C6). Glyceraldehyde is an important intermediate molecule of photosynthesis. Figure 3.5: Cyclic structure or Haworth projection of alpha-D-glucopyranose (alpha-D-glucose; left) and beta-D-fructofuranose (beta-D-fructose; right) As previously mentioned, pentoses and hexoses have the tendency to form cyclic or ring molecules ‘through a nucleophilic addition reaction between the carbonyl group and one of the hydroxyls of the same molecule. The reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging oxygen atom’ (Wikipedia contributors 2018e). The most common rings are made of 5 or 6 atoms, respectively with four C atoms and one O atom, and, five C atoms and one O atom (cyclic forms also referred to as furanose and pyranose, respectively, because they closely resemble furan, and pyran rings). In Figure 3.5, both glucose and fructose are hexoses. But fructose generally forms furanose rings (5 atoms, including one oxygen atom), while glucose forms pyranose rings. The α and β correspond to whether the hydroxyl on the C#1 atom is below (α) or above (β) the plan made by the ring. Some more jargon here added for exactness of information only. Figure 3.6: Cyclic structure of beta-D-Ribofuranose (beta-D-ribose) and 2-deoxyribose Ribose and deoxyribose are the most important pentoses we need to know as they constitute one of the three ensembles that constitute nucleotides, i.e., the monomers of nucleic acids. They both exist either in furanose or pyranose forms, although the furanose form dominates, but the difference between ribose and deoxyribose is the missing oxygen atom on the C2’ atom (Figure 3.6). And yes, you guessed it right, this difference is the reason for the ‘R’ and ‘D’ in the RNA and DNA molecules. Notice that the carbon atoms are numbered in Figures 3.5 and 3.6. The numbers are ‘primed’ for the ribose and deoxyribose (Figure 3.6). This is a convention that geneticians have used to differentiate the carbons from the pentose to those of the base in nucleotides (see part on nucleic acids). This is anecdotal information again. Now, as the pentoses and hexoses form rings, an interesting group appears and is referred to as the acetal group. Yet another term needed to understand some of the subtleties of the functions of the di- and polysaccharides… For the aldohexoses to form rings, the aldehyde on carbon #1 (Figures 3.3) reacts with the hydroxyl of carbon #5 to form a 6 atom ring (e.g. for glucose on Figure 3.5). And in can easily revert to the chain structure to have a free aldehyde again and be a reducing sugar. For fructose, a ketohexose, the ketone from carbon #2, reacts with the hydroxyl of also carbon #5, to now form a 5 atom ring (Fructose on Figure 3.5). So why is this important enough to be mentioned here…? In the ring versions of the glucose and fructose, the carbons #1 and #2 now have single bounds with two oxygen atoms. This group formed by a central carbon, and bonds in a tetrahedral as illustrated in Figure 3.7 is a rather special bond. In fact, special enough that it has some interesting consequences, with two different forms. If one of the atoms bound to oxygen is different than hydrogen (e.g., R’ and R&quot; in Figure 3.7 both not H), then this group is called an acetal group, and the bond is a rather stable bond. If one of the R’ or R&quot; in Figure 3.7 is H, while the other has some other radical, then the structure becomes asymetric, the group formed is then called hemiacetal as is not nearly as stable, which explains why the hexoses so easily switch from the linear chain to the cyclic configurations. This hemiacetal group is one of the basis of the glycosidic bond, which binds the cyclic pentoses and hexoses in di- and polysaccharides, but also with other molecules. Figure 3.7: Structure of a generic acetal By NEUROtiker - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3508032 So, what is there to remember about monosaccharides? Their formula is (CH2O)n where 3 &lt; n &lt; 6 generally The C3 atom monosaccharide to remember is glyceraldehyde Small differences in the position of hydroxyl, and in the cyclisation of the C5 and C6 make for different monosaccharides Each atom has on average 4 electrons for itself, making monosaccharides the ideal molecule to store and release energy electrons, although they have to be in the aldose chain form Thanks to all the hydroxyl groups, monosaccharides are extremely soluble in water. Glucose is arguably the most important monosaccharide and the only hexose molecule you are expected to know how to draw For glucose, and for organic chemistry in general, there are several ways of representing molecules. One of the ways is the Haworth projection as shown in Figures 3.5 and 3.6. Another way is called the Fischer projection as illustrated in Figures 3.3 and 3.4. Another way is called the skeletal formula where the carbons are implied at the corners and the ends of line segments, while oxygen and other remarkable radicals such as hydroxyl or amine are noted. Glucose is thus often represented as skeletal formula as the left in Figure 3.8. Another even more simplified representation of glucose is represented in the ‘hyper’ skeletal formula. The latter has the advantage to be simple enough to be used to illustrate polysaccharides. Figure 3.8: Skeletal formula for alpha-D-glucose (left) and ‘hyper’ skeletal formula (right) 3.2.2 Dissacharides Sucrose, lactose, and maltose are three common dissaccharides. Dissharides are bioses or polymers of two hexose monomers. Because they are still small, and thanks to their solubility in water (thanks to hydroxyl groups), they play an essential role to transport energy in chemical forms because for a slight increase of the osmotic pressure in a liquid, dissaccharides carry twice the number of electrons. Dissaccharides correspond to the assemblage of two monosaccharides thanks to the glycosidic bond. The name of this bond suggests that it is very specific to carbohydrates, and it is true as one monosaccharide must be involved in a glysidic bond. So the glycosidic bond is a type of covalent bond that joins a carbohydrate (sugar) molecule to another group, which may or may not be another carbohydrate. There are 4 types of glycosidic bonds, depending on the atom directly linked to the hemiacetal carbon of the carbohydrate: O-, N-, S-, or C-glycosidic bonds. Figure 3.9 illustrates the generic O- and N-glycosidic bond. Figure 3.9: Formation of glycosidic bonds between a hemiacetal Carbon and a hydroxyl or amine group, to respectively form O- and N-glycosidic bonds. The N-glycosidic bond occurs in nucleotides and thus plays a major role. But overall, the term glycosidic bond generally refers to the O-glycosidic bond between two consecutive monosaccharides (Figure 3.10). In the end, and to go back to the brick and mortar analogy, for di- and polysaccharides, the glycosidic bond is the equivalent of the mortar. Figure 3.10: Formation of glycosidic bonds between a glucose hemiacetal carbon and a methyl hydroxyde (top) or between two glucoses to form maltose Lactose and maltose (Figure 3.11) are dissaccharides, respectively assembled from a galactose and a glucose, and, from two glucose molecules. Notice that these two molecules are reducing sugars, i.e., there is one hemicetal carbon (C#1) free to potentially open one glucose into a chain form, hence the ability for both lactose and maltose to be readily available as electron donors. This is quite nice for lactose produced by mammal females to be readily available for their offsprings. On another note, during seed germination, starch (details below) is hydrolyzed into maltose first by the amylase enzyme, and then readily participate in energy generation for this critical time of seed plant lives. Figure 3.11: Lactose and maltose dissaccharides molecular formulae Interestingly, sucrose in not a reducing sugar as both hemiacetal carbons (C#1 of glucose, and C#2 of fructose) are part of the glycosidic bond (Figure 3.12). There are several advantages: Figure 3.12: Sucrose molecular formula Sucrose is a very stable molecule, and a lot more than lactose and maltose. Hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond is very slow and solutions of sucrose can last for a very long time. Because both hemiacetal carbons are bound, there are no more possibilities for an additional glycosidic bond to take place: sucrose stay as a dissaccharide This is actually essential for green vascular plants, which assemble sucrose in their leaves from glucose and fructose, but must transport these molecules away from the leaves for to minimize weight and avoid jamming of the photosynthesis. So having a very stable, highly soluble, none polymerisable, non reducing molecule is very advantageous. Sucrose can then be hydrolyzed thanks to the sucrase enzyme into glucose and fructose again for use or storage at other places in the plants. So what is there to remember? Dissacharides are small molecules which are easily soluble and easily transportable. For the a very similar osmotic pressure, dissaccharides carry twice as many electrons as monosaccharides: dissaccharides are the ‘go to’ transport molecules Sucrose is a non reducing sugar, which allows transportation of a precious cargo in sap very far from where it was produced (think about sequoias!) 3.2.3 Polyssaccharides Polysaccharides are polymers of monosaccharides linked together thanks to the glycosidic bond, forming sometimes very long chains (at least more than 10 monosaccharides, or else are referred to oligosaccharides), either linear or branched. Polysaccharides generally have two main functions: energy storage or structure. Because of the glycosidic bond, which removes a molecule of H2O, the general formula for a large polysaccharide is more like (C6H10O5)n often with 200 &lt; n &lt; 3500. For our purpose, it is important to rememver that there are three main polysaccharides (Figure 3.13): starch and glycogen, which are both energy storage molecules for plants, and animals, respectively, and, cellulose which has a structure function making a lot of the plants cell walls. Figure 3.13: Starch, glycogen, and cellulose are the three main polysaccharides of importance for our field. Obtained from https://www.sedelco.org/cms/lib/PA01001902/Centricity/Domain/506/05_Lecture_Presentation.pdf All three molecules are polymers of α- and β D-glucoses. Starch is a polymer of α-D-glucoses linked together by carbons 1 and 4. Glycogen has essentially the same structure, although it has some branches thanks to a bound between carbon 1 and 6 (Figure 3.14). Figure 3.14: Illustration of the 1-4 links between monomers of alpha-D-glucose for starch, plus 1-6 links to form branches for glycogen, and 1-4 links between monomers of beta-D-glucose for cellulose. Obtained from https://biochemikages005.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/carbohydrates/ Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on earth. Thanks to the hydrogen bonds between adjacent β-D-glucose polymers, very strong cellulose microfibrils form, themselves bundled into macrofibrils. Cellulose molecules can be hydrolyzed thanks to the cellulase enzyme, generally secreted by bacteria, although animals such as termites do produce a cellulase. Most mammals only have a limited ability to digest cellulose fibers, and even ruminants and monogastric herbivores use symbiotic bacteria to produce cellulase. 3.2.4 Other carbohydrates This chapter is still under construction References "],

As a result, it tends to trace quantities in nature When dissolved in water, and depending on the pH of the solution, ammonia converts to ammonium following the reaction: \\[ H_2O + NH_3 \\rightleftharpoons OH^{-} + NH_4^{+} \\] Production: Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals. Dozens of chemical plants worldwide produce ammonia. Consuming more than 1% of all man-made power, ammonia production is a significant component of the world energy budget. In 2014, about 88% of the ammonia produced was used for fertilizing agricultural crops Modern ammonia-producing plants generally depend on the Haber-Bosch process which consists into reducing dinitrogen into ammonia \\[ 3\\,H_2 + N_2 \\to 2\\,NH_3 \\] Consumption: Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen-containing compounds. Virtually all synthetic nitrogen compounds are derived from ammonia. back to top 4.1.4 Ammonium Ammonium is the most reduced inorganic nitrogenous cation (positively charged). Ammonium 3D shape: Lewis dot structure: Number of electron N has for itself following electronegativity rule: eight It is formed by the protonation of ammonia following the reaction: \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O + NH_3 \\rightleftharpoons OH^{-} + NH_4^{+} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] The relative abundance of ammonium vs ammonia depends on the pH of the solution. See figure below Because in most natural aqueous environments, pH is below 8, ammonium tends to be the preponderant form. Production: In nature, ammonium is a waste product of the mineralization of organic molecules It is added as fertilizer on soils as ammonium nitrate Health hazard: Ammonia vapor has a sharp, irritating, pungent odor that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death Drinking water standard: back to top 4.1.5 Ammonium nitrate Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound, the nitrate salt of the ammonium cation It is a white crystal solid and is highly soluble in water. Formula: \\(NH_4NO_3\\) 3D shape: It is predominantly used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer Its other major use is as a component of explosive mixtures used in mining, quarrying, and civil construction Production: Ammonium nitrate does exist naturally in mines of the Atacama desert in Chile but globally nearly all ammonium nitrate is now produced synthetically Byproduct of all respiration processes. Ammonium ions are a waste product of the metabolism of animals. In fish and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the urea cycle to urea, because urea is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into uric acid, which is solid and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss. Consumption/utilization: It is used as a fertilizer, because it tends to release inorganic nitrogen slowly in soil. Applied as a surface fertilizer, it penetrates the soil with rainfall infiltration. Highly soluble, the nitrate anion becomes readily available to plant roots, although it is susceptible to leaching below the root system into the shallow and deep groundwater. The ammonium cation tends to adsorb to soil particles and is thus not as susceptible to leaching. Ammonium can be directly uptaken by plant roots, which thermodynamically makes sense, although because in most soils aerobic conditions are preponderant, nitrate tends to be the ion uptaken most often. Soil bacteria in the aerobic zone of the soil will oxidize adsorbed ammonium into nitrate, which then becomes available for plant roots. The whole chain of events slows the release of inorganic nitrogen to crops and thus makes for more effective fertilizers.

Carbonate serves as the carbon source for aquatic vegetation Carbonic acid can then dissociate into bicarbonate (\\(HCO_3^-\\)) and carbonate (\\(CO_3^{2-}\\)) The term “bicarbonate” was coined in 1814 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston. The prefix “bi” in “bicarbonate” comes from an outdated naming system and is based on the observation that there is twice as much carbonate (CO32−) per sodium ion in sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and other bicarbonates than in sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and other carbonates. The name lives on as a trivial name. (Wikipedia contributors 2018a). \\[\\begin{align} H_2CO_3 &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; HCO_3^- + H^+ \\tag{4.2} \\\\ HCO_3^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; CO_3^{2-} + H^+ \\tag{4.3} \\end{align}\\] In an environment not open to the atmosphere (or where direct exchange with the atmosphere is very limited like in stream or wetland sediment), the preponderant form depends on the pH and can be calculated as illustrated on the graph below. Carbon dioxide and carbonates are fully oxidized forms of inorganic molecules with just one atom of C: the carbon atom has zero electrons for itself as shown in Figure 4.1 Figure 4.1: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of C, including from left to right CO2, carbonic acid, hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate), and carbonate, showing that the C atoms have no electrons for themselves In sea water, Carbonate can combine with Ca2+ to form Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3), which precipitates out of solution. In other words, calcium carbonate formation is a sink for carbonate, and ultimately from CO2 addition from the atmosphere to to increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Carbonates are thus a great pH buffer in aquatic environments 4.2.3 Catabolism Reactions involving the breaking down of organic substrates, typically by oxidative breakdown, to provide chemically available energy (e.g. A TP) and/or to generate metabolic intermediates used in subsequent anabolic reactions (De Bolster 1997). Synonyms: Aerobic and anaerobic respirations which use organic molecules as electron donors, are synonyms of catabolism. In soil science another synonym of catabolism is mineralization, which refers to the decomposition or oxidation of the chemical compounds in organic matter releasing the nutrients contained in those compounds into soluble inorganic forms that may be plant-accessible (Wikipedia contributors 2018d). 4.3 D 4.3.1 Denitrification The microbially mediated dissimilatory reduction of nitrate into dinitrogen see denitrification in chapters for more details 4.3.2 Dihydrogen sulfide see hydrogen sulfide back to top 4.4 E 4.4.1 Eutrophication Definitions: ‘an increase in the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem’ (Nixon 1995) ‘is the enrichment of a water body with nutrients, usually with an excess amount of nutrients’ (Wikipedia) ‘the enrichment of water by nutrients, especially nitrogen and/or phosphorus, causing an accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms present in the water and to the quality of water concerned’ (Anonymous 1991b) ‘the enrichment of water by nitrogen compounds causing an accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms present in the water and to the quality of water concerned’ (Anonymous 1991a) back to top 4.5 F 4.5.1 Fischer projection see Structural formula back to top 4.6 G 4.6.1 Greenhouse gases (GHG) A greenhouse gas is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth’s surface would be about −18 °C (0 °F), rather than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F). In the Solar System, the atmospheres of Venus, Mars and Titan also contain gases that cause a greenhouse effect.

In other words, for the pH of most natural waters (4.5 &lt; pH &lt; 8), \\(HNO_3\\) is totally insignificant. Production: from the complete oxidation of inorganic nitrogenous molecules which include ammonia, ammonium, nitrite from the mineralization and complete oxidation of amine radicals in organic molecules Consumption: Uptake from microbes, plants, and algae for their anabolism, which consists in building complex organic molecules from inorganic ones. Uptake, assimilation, anabolism, immobilization are all synonymous terms to express the fact that the N atom is immobilized, at least temporarily in organic molecules. Because N is assimilated in organic molecules during uptake/anabolism, and because N gains electrons in the process (it is thus reduced), we refer to nitrate uptake as assimilatory nitrate reduction. Denitrification: under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is used by facultative anaerobes as electron acceptor to generate ATP in their respiration chain. The two major end products of denitrification are gases, namely dinitrogen (\\(N_2\\)) and nitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\)), which leave the aqueous environment. As such, nitrate is not assimilated by any bacteria and denitrification is therefore, as opposed to uptake, referred to as **dissimilatory nitrate reduction into dinitrogen (\\(N_2\\)) and nitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\)). Ecological significance: Because of assimilation and denitrification processes, the overall nitrate concentrations in rivers tends to diminish from the catchment headwaters to the receiving bodies such as estuaries and coastal areas. As a result, inorganic nitrogen has naturally been in very short supply in these coastal water bodies, and nitrate and traditionally been the nutrient limiting aquatic productivity there. Very much like with phosphate, algae have adapted to be able to grow in very low concentrations. Anthropogenic activities, and agriculture in particular, have largely increased the loads and concentration of nitrate reaching estuaries, to the point where nitrate is no longer the limiting factor. As a result, excess nitrate is one of the reasons for the global and persistent presence of algal blooms in estuaries and coastal waters. Health hazard: There is a heated debate about the health hazard that nitrate might pose. Some argue that if anything, there might be beneficial effects, while others argue that there are evidence of cancers linked to excess nitrate absorption. Unfortunately, arguments on both sides might not be totally independent of militantism and lobbies. The only consensus everybody seems to agree upon is the Blue Baby syndrome, or methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobinemia is an unusual and potentially fatal condition in which hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin and loses its ability to bind and transport oxygen, hence the cyanosis (blue appearance) usually visible on fingers, toes, and lips. Nitrate reduced to nitrite in the body of humans and animals enters the body stream where it seems to directly oxidize oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin-peroxide complex. Picture of a Blue Baby from syndromespedia.com/blue-baby-syndrome.html Drinking water standards Although there is still a heated debate whether or not nitrate does have have detrimental health effects, the World Health Organization has provided maximum concentration guidelines of 50 mg/L as nitrate (World Health Organization 2011). These guidelines have been enacted in hard laws in the US and in Europe. The 50 mg/L as nitrate equates 11.2 mg \\(NO_3\\)-N/L and in the US, the drinking water standard is 10 mg \\(NO_3\\)-N/L. back to top 4.10.2 Nitrous Oxide Commonly known as laughing gas Nitrous oxide has significant medical uses, especially in surgery and dentistry, for its anesthetic and pain reducing effects.

The term oxidation was first used by Antoine Lavoisier to signify reaction of a substance with oxygen. Much later, it was realized that the substance, upon being oxidized, loses electrons, and the meaning was extended to include other reactions in which electrons are lost. back to top 4.11.3 Oxidation state The oxidation state (OS), or sometimes referred to as the oxidation number, quantifies the number of electrons that an atom has gained (expressed as negative charge value) or lost (expressed as positive charge value) compared to the number of valence electrons it has in its free form. As a result, it can be zero, positive or negative. For metal ions, the OS corresponds to its charge The change in oxidation state is a very powerful tool to understand the redox processes involved in the environement. But OS is less than ideal when comparing the absolute number of electrons one element has for itself For example, the nitrogen atom N, has 5 valence electrons. In the dinitrogen molecule N2, the Lewis dot structure suggests that each atom share 3 electrons with the other but essentially have 5 electrons for themselves as in Figure 4.2 Figure 4.2: Electron allocation on each of the N atom for the dinitrogen molecule N2 As a result, the number of electron on each atom equals the number of valence electrons on the free form of N, hence OS = 0. Now in the nitrous oxide case in Figure 4.3, the nitrogen atom to the left OS = 0, but for the middle Nitrogen atom, OS = -2, as two electrons were stripped by oxygen. Figure 4.3: Electron allocation on each of the N atom for the N2O molecule The problem with the oxidation state indicator is that it is a relative number, and not absolute. The electron allocation indicator that quantifies the number of electrons each atom has for itself is more abolute and thus comparable. For example, the inorganic molecule with one C atom stable in an oxidized environment is CO2, the inorganic molecule with one N atom stable in an oxidized environment is \\(NO_3^-\\), and the inorganic molecule with one S atom stable in an oxidized environment is \\(SO_4^{2-}\\). All three atoms have zero electrons for themselves as oxygen has ‘stolen’ them (Figure 4.4). So they are all potential electron acceptors that can accept up to 8 electrons. In a way they are very similar. Figure 4.4: Electron allocation on each of the C, N, and S atom for the CO2, nitrate and sulfate molecules But if one calculates the oxidation states for each of the C, N, and S atoms, for these three molecules, one would find OSC = -4, OSN = -5, and OSS = -6… We believe this can be very confusing and prefer to use the electron allocation concept as a more absolute indicator. back to top 4.12 P 4.12.1 Phosphate Phosphate is an inorganic chemical and a salt-forming anion of phosphoric acid Formula: \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) Phosphate is one of the anions of the polyprotic acid (i.e., which can liberate several protons \\(H^{+}\\)) The conjugate bases of phosphate are: All conjugate bases are related through the set acid-base chemical equilibria: \\[\\begin{align} H_3PO_4 &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; H_2PO_4^- + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 2.12}\\\\ H_2PO_4^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; HPO_4^{2-} + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 7.21}\\\\ HPO_4^{2-}&amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; PO_4^{3-} + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 12.67} \\end{align}\\] The preponderant form of phosphate in a solution also depends on the pH following this relationship: The phosphoric acid and phosphates are fully oxidized forms of inorganic molecules with just one atom of P: the Phosphorus atom has zero electrons for itself as shown in Figure 4.5 below: Figure 4.5: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of P, including from left to right Phosphoric acid, dihydrogen Phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, and phosphate , showing that the P atoms have no electrons for themselves Production: Phosphorus in general and phosphate in practice has remained one of the nutrients limiting the most plant productivity on our planet Phosphates are the naturally occurring form of the element phosphorus, found in many phosphate minerals Phosphate minerals are mined to obtain phosphorus for use in agriculture and industry The largest global producer and exporter of phosphates is Morocco. Within North America, the largest deposits lie in the Bone Valley region of central Florida, the Soda Springs region of southeastern Idaho, and the coast of North Carolina (near Aurora). Consumption: Uptake from all primary producer including plants and algae Phosphate can also be immobilized by bacteria In food industry, phosphates help baked goods rise, they act as emulsifiers in processed cheese and canned soup, they add flavor to cola and color to frozen french fries. They also can be added to meat, poultry and seafood to help the protein bind more water, making it juicier after freezing and reheating. Ecological significance: Phosphorus as phosphate naturally is the most limiting factor for primary productivity for land and aquatic plants. Because it tends to bind to particles, phosphates have accumulated with sediment particularly in coastal areas, where phosphate can become available again to algae through sediment diagenetic processes. As a result, phosphate is generally not considered the most limiting factor for algae in estuaries and coastal environment. However, it does tend to be the limiting nutrient in freshwater receiving bodies such as lakes and reservoirs. Excess phosphate in freshwater receiving bodies has been shown to be the nutrient causing some major eutrophication problems throughout the planet back to top 4.13 R 4.13.1 Reactive nitrogen back to top 4.13.2 Redox Redox (short for reduction–oxidation reaction) is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed. Any such reaction involves both a reduction process and a complementary oxidation process, effectively allowing the electron transfer processes. 4.13.3 Redox couple redox couples, commonly noted as ‘Ox/Red’ refer to the two forms that an element might take depending on its oxidation state Ox in ‘Ox/Red’ refers to as the oxidizer or oxidizing agent, as it has the capability to make other elements lose their electrons. Red in ‘Ox/Red’ refers to as the reducer or reducing agent, as it has the capability to give electrons to other elements Common redox couples which matter in environmental and ecological engineering include: CO2/CH2O O2/H2O NO3-/N2 NO3-/NH4+ NO3-/NO2- MnO2/Mn2+ Fe3+/Fe2+ SO42-/H2S CO2/CH4 4.13.4 Redox half-reactions A half reaction is either the oxidation or reduction reaction component of a redox reaction. A half reaction is obtained by considering the change in oxidation states of individual substances involved in the redox reaction (Wikipedia contributors 2018b) Redox half reactions illustrate the transfer of electrons from the oxidized form of an element to a reduced form of an element. Half-reactions are often used as a method of balancing redox reactions To derive half-reactions, the first convention is that the oxidizer is on the left of the equation, and the reducer on the right one must first equilibrate all elements other than O and H then one balances for O, by adding H2O on the appropriate side of the half reaction then one adds the appropriate number of H+ to balance the H Finally one adds the appropriate number of e- to balance the charge. The number of e- must correspond to the change in oxidation state The half-reactions corresponding to the redox couples above are: CO2/CH2O \\[\\begin{equation} CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightleftharpoons CH_2O + H_2O \\end{equation}\\] CH2O here is a generic formula to represent the electron donating capacity of OM. This equation might be misleading as it corresponds to the OM donating 4 electrons in the respiration schemes, but because it is written using the ox/red convention, is the opposite of the intuitive direction. So a more intuitive half-reaction might be, and is effectively what is used to write the full redox reaction: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\end{equation}\\] O2/H2O \\[\\begin{equation} O_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightleftharpoons 4H_2O \\end{equation}\\] NO3-/N2 \\[\\begin{equation} 2 NO_3^- + 10 e^- + 12 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons N_2 + 6 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] MnO2/Mn2+ \\[\\begin{equation} MnO_2 + 4 e^- + 4 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons Mn^{2+} + 2 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] Fe3+/Fe2+ \\[\\begin{equation} Fe^{3+} + 1 e^- \\rightleftharpoons Fe^{2+} \\\\ \\end{equation}\\] SO42-/H2S \\[\\begin{equation} SO_4^{2-} + 8 e^- + 10 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons H_2S + 4 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] CO2/CH4 \\[\\begin{equation} CO_2 + 8 e^- + 8 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons CH_4 + 2 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] a redox reaction always involves two half reactions where the electrons are transfered from the lowest redox potential couple to the highest redox potential couple. For example, the combustion of methane in oxygen involves the two O2/H2O and CO2/CH4 couples. The half-reaction of the highest redox potential couple goes on top, and that of the lowest potential at the bottom, but this time written as red/ox like in the equation below: \\[\\begin{align} 2\\,O_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; 4\\,H_2O\\\\ CH_4 + 2\\,H_2O &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; CO_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^-\\\\ &amp; &amp;\\\\ \\hline\\\\ CH_4 + 2\\,O_2 &amp; \\to &amp; CO_2 + 2\\,H_2O \\end{align}\\] The electrons cancel out, and in this case the protons as well. So the combustion of methane, which is very simple at first glance, really involves a transfer of electrons, which the half-reactions reveal. 4.13.5 Reduction Reduction is the gain of electrons by a molecule, atom, or ion. back to top 4.14 S 4.14.1 Skeletal formula The skeletal formula, also called line-angle formula or shorthand formula, of an organic compound is a type of molecular structural formula that serves as a shorthand representation of a molecule’s bonding and some details of its molecular geometry (Wikipedia contributors 2018g). see Structural formula 4.14.2 Structural formula 4.14.3 Sulfate Sulfate is the inorganic sulfur anion stable in oxidized water Formula: \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) Sulfate 3D shape: Lewis dot structure of nitrate: Number of electron S has for itself following electronegativity rule: zero \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) can only be an electron acceptor \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) is the conjugate base of Hydrogen sulfate \\(HSO_4^{-}\\).

We therefore generally omit to mention \\(HSO_4^{-}\\) as a chemical form that plays any significant role. During their anabolism, primary producers uptake sulfate, but the sulfur atoms can be incorporated into amino-acids only after sulfur has been reduced, or gained 8 electrons to be in a thiol (\\(-SH\\)) form.

["appendix-a.html", "A Appendix A A.1 Quick guide on atom orbitals and Lewis dot structure A.2 Orbitals hybridization A.3 σ and π bonds", " A Appendix A A.1 Quick guide on atom orbitals and Lewis dot structure The key to understanding the storage and transfer of energy in the biosphere lies on the allocation of electrons as described in Chapter 2. However, it might be a good thing to have a refresher on what electron orbitals, valence electrons, and Lewis structures are. This appendix proposes a quick refresher on these concepts. A.1.1 Electron orbitals Atoms are made of a nucleus and electrons. The nucleus itself is made of protons and neutrons. In the simplified periodic table below (Figure A.1), the first three lines of the periodic table are represented and the atomic numbers are given for each atom. The atomic number or proton number of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom. It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons (Wikipedia contributors 2018l). Figure A.1: simplified periodic table that show the s and p orbitals for the first 18 atomic numbers (number of protons = number of electrons in each atom) Orbitals express the two waves and particle natures of electrons. At the bottom of each atom box in Figure A.1, one can see odd symbols like 1s2 2s22p2 for the carbon atom. The ‘s’ and ‘p’ letters represent two different electron orbitals. The numbers 1 and 2 before the letter represent the angular momentum of the orbitals, which is also an indication of the electron energy levels. An electron orbital characterizes the high probability of where an electron might be located around the nucleus. Each orbital can be occupied by a maximum of 2 electrons. The wave nature of electrons tells us that the electrons are stable, for a given energy level, in their orbitals. For the biogeochemical processes of this book, we only deal with the CHONSP atoms, which only have s or p orbitals, not d, f, g, h, etc. What are these bizarre letters s, p, d, f, g, etc. describing orbitals anyway…? They are derived from the description by early spectroscopists of certain series of alkali metal spectroscopic lines as sharp, principal, diffuse, and fundamental&quot; (Wikipedia contributors 2018l). So now, for the low energy level 1, the orbital s appears to be a sphere. In other words the one or two atoms in this orbital will have a very high probability of being in that sphere. The one electron of hydrogen will thus be somewhere in that orbital. For helium, its two electrons will be in this sphere as well and be extremely stable. With only one electron in its orbital, hydrogen is just not very stable, and it ‘tries’ to bond with other atoms such that they can ‘share’ electrons so that the H 1s orbital is ‘visited’ by 2 electrons, which makes hydrogen ‘happy’ and stable. Now, for lithium and Beryllium, which have 3 and 4 electrons (Figure A.1), respectively, their electrons fill a new s orbital, which also is a s orbital with a spherical shape as well, just bigger as the electrons have more energy. Boron and Carbon have 5 and 6 electrons, and their orbitals are not spheres any more. The theory tells that the high probability for these electrons is to be in a space that looks like two ‘eggs’ opposed to each other (Figure A.2). These are called p orbitals. There can be 3 p orbitals which are located along three x,y,z axes with the exact same level of energy. Figure A.2: Shape of the electron orbitals s, p, d, and f. Obtained from https://chem.libretexts.org/ Electron orbitals that have the same energy levels are called degenerate orbitals. The lower energy orbitals are filled before higher energy orbitals. Hund’s rule states that degenerate orbitals are filled evenly before moving to higher energy orbitals. For p orbitals, which consist of three degenerate orbitals that all have exactly the same energy level, we put a single electron in each orbital first then put a second electron (of opposite spin, we have not mentioned spins yet, and will not here) in each orbital to fill them with a total of six electrons. Figure A.3: Hund’s rule to correctly fill in orbitals for the Carbon and Nitrogen atoms. Up and down arrows represent the electron spins. Electrons have to have opposite spins to be located in the same orbital. This has little impact for our purpose The electrons for Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur in their orbitals are represented in Figure A.4 below. you can see that, N and P, and O and S 2p and 3p orbitals, respectively, follow the same ‘filling’ patterns. Figure A.4: Hund’s rule to correctly fill in orbitals for the Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sufur atoms A.2 Orbitals hybridization This is what the theory tells us. In practice, it seems that the interactions of electrons among orbitals, and with bond atoms, make things a little different and new hybrid orbitals actually form. This is the basis of geometrical configuration of molecules and explains the shape of molecules and angles between atoms in a molecule. Does it really matter in biogeochemical processes? Actually quite a bit. Starting with the shape of the water molecule. But before then, let us explain orbital hybridization using the illustration in Figure A.5. Figure A.5: sp, sp2, and sp3 orbital hybridization and illustration for the carbon atom The electronic signature for carbon is 1s2 2s22p2. The Hund’s rule for filling orbitals suggests (Figure A.4) that one of the p orbital has not electron. Orbital hybridization consists in moving one of the electron in the 2s orbital to fill this empty p orbital. But since electrons on the s orbital are much less energetic than the p ones, the electrons in the resulting new hybrid orbitals are not going to be as energetic. Three possible hybrid orbitals exist in nature: sp, sp2, and sp3 orbitals. For the example of carbon, there also are three orbital configurations. The lowest energy hybridization is that the 4 electrons on 2s22p2 end up in four orbitals, i.e., two in 2 sp orbitals and two in 2 p orbitals, one electron in each. This is the configuration illustrated at the bottom row, and application of this configuration is the CO2 molecule (Figure A.5). The mid energetic configuration is also four orbitals, but this time with 3 sp2 orbitals and 1 p orbital. This is the configuration illustrated at the middle row with an application being the aldehyde configuration in a molecule. The highest energy hybrid orbital is referred to as sp3, where the original 2s22p2 are hybridized into 4 sp3 orbitals, leading to a tetrahedral configuration of the orbitals, with methane being an illustration. So, the same atom can practically change its orbital configuration. And all of this depends on the molecule in which this atom is involved. This is true for all atoms, and particularly the ones we are concerned about, i.e., C, N, O, P, and S (H orbital does not change!). Since, hybridizations change depending on molecular configurations (and vice versa), it is time to recall the two types of atomic bonds prevailing in molecules of interest to us: the σ and π bonds. A.3 σ and π bonds In chemistry, sigma bonds (σ bonds) are the strongest type of covalent chemical bond. They are formed by head-on overlapping between atomic orbitals. […] A σ-bond is symmetrical with respect to rotation about the bond axis. […] Sigma bonds are the strongest type of covalent bonds due to the direct overlap of orbitals, and the electrons in these bonds are sometimes referred to as sigma electrons. (Wikipedia contributors 2018i) A covalent bond, also called a molecular bond, is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full outer shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration. (Wikipedia contributors 2018k) For the CHONSP atoms, σ bonds can be formed between s, p, and spn orbitals (Figure A.6).

The Greek letter π in their name refers to p orbitals, since the orbital symmetry of the pi bond is the same as that of the p orbital when seen down the bond axis. One common form of this sort of bonding involves p orbitals themselves. […] Pi bonds are usually weaker than sigma bonds. (Wikipedia contributors 2018h) Typically, a single bond is a sigma bond while a multiple bond is composed of one sigma bond together with pi or other bonds. A double bond has one sigma plus one pi bond, and a triple bond has one sigma plus two pi bonds. Now that all these important concepts are properly described, some illustrations and important consequences of bonds and orbital hybridization can be useful. Important examples of sp3 orbitals leading to tetrahedral molecular configurations include water H2O, NH3, NH4+, CH4, PO43-. In the molecule of water, the oxygen orbitals are hybrid sp3 and two of them from two σ covalent bonds with hydrogen, leaving two sp3 orbitals as two lone pairs or electrons (Figure A.7). Figure A.7: The sp3 hybrid orbitals in H2O, leaving two lone pairs of electrons in two of the orbitals. Obtained freely under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license These lone electron pairs, opposite to the bonds with the H atoms, thus form an important electronic density, rendering the molecules asymetric both on a geometric and on a charge basis, with the two lone pairs forming a slight electronegative side of the molecule, and the two hydrogen atoms, forming a slight electron positive side of the molecule (Figure A.8). The water molecules are thus referred to as: polar molecule, i.e., it “has a net dipole as a result of the opposing charges (i.e. having partial positive and partial negative charges) from polar bonds arranged asymmetrically” (Wikipedia contributors 2018n) As a result water is a good polar solvent that dissolves salts and hydrophilic organic molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, mono-, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. “Because of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules. These bonds are the cause of water’s high surface tension and capillary forces” (Wikipedia contributors 2018q). It is thanks to these capillary forces that soils can store very significant amount of water which plants can use for their growth even during drought times. “The hydrogen bonds are also the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of other analogous compounds like hydrogen sulfide (H 2S). They also explain its exceptionally high specific heat capacity (about 4.2 J/g/K), heat of fusion (about 333 J/g), heat of vaporization (2257 J/g), and thermal conductivity (between 0.561 and 0.679 W/m/K). These properties make water more effective at moderating Earth’s climate, by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere.” (Wikipedia contributors 2018q) Figure A.8: Illustration of the electric dipole of the water molecule due slight electronegativities and positivies on the O and H atoms, respectively; Hydrogen bonds are one the consequence the polar nature of water.
