An acid necessarily contains an atom of hydrogen. The two forms exchanging a proton a referred to as conjugate acid and base. Technically, a proton or hydrogen ion cannot exist unhydrated in water solution. And technically, in water, a proton is hydrated to produce the hydronium ion: \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O + proton \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_0 \\tag{8.1} \\end{equation}\\] So technically, donating a proton for an acid necessarily involves the molecule of water as in the equilibrium (8.2) \\[\\begin{equation} acid + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ + conjugate base \\hspace{2.5cm} K_1 \\tag{8.2} \\end{equation}\\] One can dissociate, however this reaction in two elementary reactions as \\[\\begin{equation} acid \\rightleftharpoons proton + conjugate base \\hspace{2.5cm} K_2 \\\\ H_2O + proton \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_0 \\tag{8.3} \\end{equation}\\] Because the activity of water essentially constant in dilute aqueous solutions, the hydration of the proton can be ignored in defining acid-base equilibria (Stumm and Morgan 1996). The thermodynamic convention sets the standard free enery change ΔG° for reaction (8.1) equal to zero, of its rate constant K0=1. So from now on, the molecule of water is purposely omitted in acid-base reactions herein, and the hydrated proton is written as H+. In the equilibrium (8.4) below, the acid is represented as HA. It can donate a proton H+. The anion A- is referred to as the conjugate base. \\[\\begin{equation} HA \\rightleftharpoons A^- + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_A \\tag{8.4} \\end{equation}\\] Another example of an acid, is illustrated in equilibrium (8.5) where the acid is an anion (cation in the generic example below), and the conjugate base is an uncharged molecule. \\[\\begin{equation} HA^+ \\rightleftharpoons A + H^+ \\tag{8.5} \\end{equation}\\] Some molecules can be both an acid and a base: they are referred to as being amphoteric. Water is the most famous amphoteric molecule as it can donate a proton to yield a hydroxide OH-, or gain an electron to form the hydronium cation H3O+ as illustrated in equilibria (8.6) \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O \\rightleftharpoons OH^- + H^+ \\\\ H_2O + H^+ \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ \\tag{8.6} \\end{equation}\\] By convention, however, the acid conjugate is always placed on the left of the equilibria, and the conjugate base and the proton H+ are placed on the right side of the equilibrium. 8.2 Acid-base equilibrium parameters 8.2.1 KA Like for all chemical reactions, it is possible to write down the equilibrium constant as the product of the activities of the products divided by the product of the activities of the reactants as in equation (8.7): \\[\\begin{equation} K_A = \\frac{\\{A^-\\}\\{H^+\\}}{\\{HA\\}} \\tag{8.7} \\end{equation}\\] where the activity of HA is written as \\(\\{HA\\}\\). For natural waters, a very good approximation of an element chemical activities is its concentration and the expression of KA can be expressed as in equation (8.8): \\[\\begin{equation} K_A = \\frac{[A^-][H^+]}{[HA]} \\tag{8.8} \\end{equation}\\] where, e.g., the concentration of HA can be written as \\([HA]\\). 8.2.2 pKA When the concentration of both conjugate acids and bases are equal in a solution, the expression of KA in equation (8.8) is simplified into \\[\\begin{equation} K_A = [H^+] \\tag{8.9} \\end{equation}\\] Taking the negative of the common logarithm (base 10) on both side yields: \\[\\begin{equation} -log(K_A) = -log \\left([H^+]\\right) \\tag{8.10} \\end{equation}\\] The right side of equation (8.10) is the definition of the pH. By analogy, one can define a new term \\[\\begin{equation} pK_A = -log(K_A) \\tag{8.11} \\end{equation}\\] which corresponds to the pH value at which the concentrations of the conjugate acid and base are equal. 8.3 Self-ionization of water In all aqueous solutions, the following reaction (8.12), referred to as the autoprotolysis must be considered: \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons OH^- + H_3O^+ \\tag{8.12} \\end{equation}\\] Since in dilute solution the activity of water \\({ \\{H_2O \\} = 1}\\) the equilibrium constant for equilibrium (8.12), often referred to as the ‘ion product’ or ‘ionic product’ of water can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} K_w = \\{OH^-\\} \\{H_3O^+\\} \\equiv \\{OH^-\\} \\{H^+\\} \\tag{8.13} \\end{equation}\\] According to Stumm and Morgan (1996), at 25°C, Kw = 1.008 × 10-14 and the pH = 7.00 corresponds to the exact neutrality in pure water ([H+] = [OH-]) Technically, Kw changes with temperature, according to equation (8.14) (Harned and Owen 1958) \\[\\begin{equation} log K_w = \\frac{-4470.99}{T} + 6.0875 - 0.01706 T \\tag{8.14} \\end{equation}\\] With temperatures T expressed in °K. One can see in Figure 8.1 that the pH at exact neutrality varies with T°C reaching 7.37 at 5°C and decreasing down to about 6.84 at 35°C. So contrary to the common understanding that pH at neutrality is equal to 7, it actually changes with temperature, and not on an insignificant way. This is a reason why it is preferrable to calibrate pH probes using pH buffer solutions in the lab near 25°C. For all calculation purposes in this chapter, we will assume that the temperature is at 25°C, and we can therefore take that pH=7 at neutrality and that log Kw=-14. Figure 8.1: Kw and pH at exact neutrality as a function of T°C 8.4 Strong vs. weak acids The concept of ionization of water defines the limits within which water activity remains equal to one, while the hydroxyde OH- and hydronium H3O+ or simpler proton H+ coexist. At pH=0, all the ionization is in the form of H+, and conversely, at pH=14, all the autoprololysis of water yields only OH-. Beyond these limits, i.e., pH less than 0 and greater than 14, one cannot consider these dilute solutions in water anymore. So all acids for which the pKA (i.e., -log(KA)) is beyond the 0 to 14 values, are considered strong acids or strong bases. This means that in dilute solutions, that the acid (or the base) is entirely dissociated into its conjugate base (or acid). To better understand this, let us take nitric acid for which the pKA=-1.4. This means that there is as much HNO3 as there is NO3- at pH=-1.4. So for dilute solutions, we can consider that all HNO3 has been dissociated into NO3-, and that in fact there is no measurable HNO3 in solution. Conversely, all other acids for with the pKA is within 0 and 14 are considered weak acids, because depending on the pH, they can be either be in the HA or A- forms, if we take our generic equilibrium example \\tag{8.4}. It turns out that many inorganic nutrients of interest and all organic acids are weak acids. This property makes them either undergo transformations depending on the controling pH, but also makes them play a very significant role in buffereing the ambient pH. These weak acids are in large part responsible for the relative narrow range of pH in natural waters included in most cases between 4.5 and 8.5. 8.5 Polyprotic acids Polyprotic acids are acids that can donate more than one proton. Among the inorganic nutrients important to environmental and ecological engineering, several are polyprotic acids, namely, phosphates, carbonates, and hydrogen sulfides. Because they have the ability to donate or gain a proton, these polyprotic acids play a very special role in buffering the pH of streams, ground, lake, and sea waters, as well as that of soil pore water. Before we can fully evaluate the environmental importance of these polyprotic acids, let us consider a generic theoritical case. Let us take a generic triprotic acid able to donate up to three protons. Three equilibrium reactions coexist in solution, in addition to the autoprotolysis of water (8.15). It becomes interesting to evaluate, depending on the pH, the relative importance of each of the forms. Before we start the calculations, let us establish some simple methodological rules that greatly help solve most of chemistry problems. Always: Write all the reaction equilibria at play list all the ionic forms at play List all the non-ionic forms Establish the electroneutrality of the solution by balancing the positive and negative charges of the ions at play Establish the conservation of mass when possible Equilibria at play: \\[\\begin{equation} H_3A \\rightleftharpoons H_2A^- + H^+ \\hspace{3.5cm} K_1 \\\\ H_2A^- \\rightleftharpoons HA^{2-} + H^+ \\hspace{3.5cm} K_2 \\\\ HA^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons A^{3-} + H^+ \\hspace{3.5cm} K_3 \\\\ H_2O \\rightleftharpoons OH^- + H^+ \\hspace{3.5cm} K_w \\tag{8.15} \\end{equation}\\] List of the ionic forms: cations: \\(H^+\\) anions: \\(H_2A^-\\), \\(HA^{2-}\\), \\(A^{3-}\\), \\(OH^-\\) List of all other forms: \\(H_3A\\), \\(H_2O\\) Electroneutrality of the solution: \\([H^+] = [H_2A^-] + 2\\times[HA^{2-}] + 3\\times[A^{3-}] + [OH^-]\\) The factor 2 before \\(2\\times[HA^{2-}]\\) expresses the relative contribution of the concentration \\([HA^{2-}]\\) to the total negative charge. The same is true for \\(3\\times[A^{3-}]\\). Conservation of mass: The summation of all the conjugate forms is often referred to as ‘total concentration’ or \\(C_T\\) \\(C_T = [H_3A] + [H_2A^-] + [HA^{2-}] + [A^{3-}]\\) This chapter is still under construction References "]
