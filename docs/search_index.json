[["index.html", "Fundamental Hydro-Biogeochemistry for Ecological Engineering and Environmental Sciences Preface Author", " Fundamental Hydro-Biogeochemistry for Ecological Engineering and Environmental Sciences François Birgand 2023-02-09 Preface During my career, I have observed that Ecological and Environmental Engineers have access in their curriculum to strong engineering and hydrological fundamentals, at the cost of rudimentary exposure to biology, microbiology, biochemistry, etc. or in one word, to biogeochemistry. Fundamental and advanced knowledge in biogeochemistry already exists and is available in monumental reference books such as Biogeochemistry of Wetlands (Reddy and DeLaune 2008), or Treatment Wetlands (Kadlec and Wallace 2008), among many others. However, these books effectively target and are most beneficial to students and professionals who have acquired over time a solid background in biogeochemistry. But what about students who want to apply engineering to natural systems and want to call themselves Ecological Engineers? I hypothesized that a reference that would bridge the gap between the initial instruction and the advanced one would be very beneficial to students seeking 4-5 year degrees in Ecological and Environmental Engineering. This is the textbook part of the book. I also wanted for it to serve as a reference for targeted parts for which I have not found other references. These will be very helpful to graduate students and researchers interested in more in depth details. Overall, I thought there was a need to make better connectivity between fundamental chemistry, biochemistry, organic chemistry, microbiology, and hydrology to name a few, within the first four years of university, and also at the graduate level. I have always thought of writing a book. This became even more evident following my Ph.D. in 2000. Not that I have always loved to read and write… In fact, quite the opposite, unfortunately. But the will to transmit to others what I have learned and understood has always been stronger than my early dislike for reading and writing. My Ph.D. project at NC State University in the late 1990s was about quantifying and modeling in-stream processes in agricultural canals (Birgand 2000) so that one could couple field and in-stream models to predict nutrient loads at the outlet of artificially drained agricultural watersheds. Dr. R. Wayne Skaggs, my first and main co-advisor, was an internationally acclaimed drainage engineer and hydrologist, but not at all a biogeochemist. J. Wendell Gilliam, a pioneer and internationally acclaimed riparian zone researcher in his own right, was my second co-advisor. Although I was extremely fortunate to have such giants as role models and advisers, the expertise I had direct access to was hydrology and water quality of shallow groundwater. But surface water hydrology and quality, wetland and stream biogeochemistry, not so much. There was no course on ‘Fundamental Biogeochemistry for Potamologists’ or similar course offered back then at NC State… So, like many students, I had to build all the needed knowledge for my project directly from my reading of books and hundreds of research articles, which I manually gathered and photocopied during countless hours (yes, no pdf versions then, researchers of that and earlier era all deserve a medal!) in the already great then, and now world class NC State librairies. In retrospect, these were extraordinary times because the quest for discovery is exhilarating. However, I thought unnecessary for other students to have to go through the same difficulties. So I promised myself that I should do something about it at some point. It has taken nearly twenty years before I felt ready to engage in this daunting task, and for which I am not sure I am that well prepared. Access to transformative technology such as the bookdown package in the R software to easily produce great looking books has provided a trigger. Teaching ‘Biogeochemical Processes for Ecological Engineering’ at the undergraduate and graduate levels for many years has also helped. Physical books will always play a central role in the transmission of knowledge. Online books offer complementary and additional possibilities. Not the least of which is the automatic translation into readers’ native language, still imperfect in the early 2020s, but which technology will undoubtedly improve with time. Online books also offer colors, links, videos, animations, interactive tools, all of which rendering them possibly more approachable and less intimidating than the ~1,000 page reference books mentioned above. I have taken advantage of this new technology offered to make what I call Fundamental Hydro-Biogeochemistry hopefully more easily approachable to all and bridge the gap identified. This will doubtlessly remain an unfinished task. I vow that it might help a new generation of students and professionals acquire this basic knowledge and come up with new and transformative solutions to continue improving the quality of ground- and surface water throughout the world. Author François Birgand is Professor and University Faculty Scholar of biogeochemistry, hydrology, and ecological engineering in the department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering at North Carolina State University, in Raleigh, NC, USA. His research interests aim to provide solutions to improve the quality of water in streams and rivers. Practically, his research focuses on improving the treatment efficiency of streams, wetlands, soils or wood chip bioreactors. Much of this research is based upon principles this textbook is attempting to provide for students of all ages. THIS BOOK IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION References "],["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Biogeochemistry applied to excess nutrients in rural aquatic environments 1.2 Ecologically engineered systems treated as black boxes 1.3 Biogeochemical processes in pollution flows 1.4 Scope of this book 1.5 Exercises", " Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Biogeochemistry applied to excess nutrients in rural aquatic environments This chapter is still under construction A query using the word ‘biogeochemistry’ on NC State University libraries’ website yielded 651 books on the subject in August 2018… So why have yet another one, or even a course that deals with biogeochemistry…?! I suppose we are never done with a subject which is rather amorphous, that involves many disciplines, and has many fields of application. Wikipedia (2018m) has some nice definitions of Biogeochemistry, including: Biogeochemistry is the study of the cycles of chemical elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, and their interactions with and incorporation into living things transported through earth scale biological systems in space through time. With the definition above, the study of ancient earth history or of modern acid rains (e.g., Degens 1989; Schlesinger 2005) are included in biogeochemistry… The unifying theme is that regardless of the application, the processes involved stay pretty much the same and involve transfer of electrons and protons. Differences within the general umbrella of biogeochemistry comes from the fields of application. The field of application of this book is excess nutrient and sediment loads generated by human activities, their consequences on aquatic ecosystems, and the processes involved in treatment systems to improve and protect groundwater and surface water quality in watersheds. There is a niche in disturbed, nutrient rich, often rural environments, where we perceive there is a need for an integrated and horizontal delivery of knowledge spanning from electron orbitals, biochemistry, cell microbiology, hydrological functioning, process kinetics modeling, and treatment system design. 1.2 Ecologically engineered systems treated as black boxes With the realization that water pollution was a true and real problem to deal with, Western countries at least, enacted laws starting in the 1970s (the most iconic might be the ‘Clean Water Act’ or the Federal Water Pollution Control Act in the USA enacted in 1972 (“S. 2770, Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972,” n.d.; Wikipedia contributors 2022a) to start regulating these pollutions. They were, and still are, classified into Point Source (PS; where the discharge could be pointed out and spatially limited including industrial and municipal discharges, as well as some agricultural facilities such as animal feedlots) and Non-Point Source (NPS) also referred to as diffuse pollution (Wikipedia contributors 2022a), in which excess nutrients in agricultural and suburban watersheds are classified. The term Best Management Practices (BMPs) has been used for a long time in the USA and Canada starting at the beginning of the XXth century (Wikipedia contributors 2020e), but was widely adopted in the agricultural and stormwater research communities in the 1990s. Canadians now prefer the term Beneficial instead of Best in BMPs, probably for good reasons as these continue to change and improve. BMPs correspond to practices that government agencies recommend to implement in the field: to lower the pollution potential at its source, such as lowering fertilization rates, or no-till practices in agricultural fields, or enhancing infiltration, and to filter out pollutants from water at the edge-of-field or edge-of-neighborhood before it would reach the hydrographic network. This book focuses on the systems that have been used over the last 50 years or so to filter out pollutants at the edge-of-field and edge-of-neighborhood. Among the most iconic discoveries of pollution filtering systems in the agricultural setting, was the discovery in the 1980s of the capacity of stream side area/forest, later referred to as Riparian zones, to largely ‘intercept’ or remove nitrate from the shallow groundwater draining from the adjacent agricultural field to the nearby stream (R. R. Lowrance and Todd 1983; Peterjohn and Correll 1984; Jacobs and Gilliam 1985; R. Lowrance et al. 1984; R. Richard Lowrance et al. 1985; R. Lowrance 1992; Haycock and Pinay 1993; Gilliam 1994). Many studies have ensued providing the general mechanisms at play and general guidance to implement such systems in watersheds (reviewed in Burt, Pinay, and Sabater 2010). Since then, many other systems have been found and implemented at the edge-of-field and edge-of-neighborhood to filter pollutants out of surface and groundwater. In this book, we will use the generic expression treatment systems to refer to them. These may include systems dedicated to the filtering out of Suspended Solids (SS) excess phosphorus, pesticides, and pathogens from surface runoff (REF) such as Vegetated Filter Strips (VFS, REF), or filtering out nitrate from groundwater, such as Riparian Zone or Denitrifying Beds (REF), or surface water, such as wetlands, bioretention zone, or stream restoration (REF). Over the last 50 years or so, we have acquired a decent idea of their overall bulk or apparent capacities to strip excess nutrients, sediment and associated pollutants. In all treatment systems, we have acknowledged the overall treatment performance is driven by the subtle balance between the biogeochemical process kinetic rates and the pollutant loading rates. In most cases, performance of treatment systems has been evaluated through the measured difference in pollutant loads between their inlets and outlets. One of the major reasons is that pollutant loads come in pulses in our treatment systems following rainfall events. One consequence is that, in many instances, treatment systems appear as ‘black boxes’ in which we know little of the internal functioning that result in the overall apparent performance. In particular, it has been very difficult to characterize the biogeochemical process kinetic rates inside these systems. In term, this gives us little chance to possibly predict and improve their performances, discover new processes, and imagine new designs and new systems. It is thus time to start investigating what happens ‘inside the black box’. Until now, environmental and ecological engineers have managed to get by with rudimentary knowledge of biogeochemistry to design systems that work. Ecologists and biologists have put a lot more emphasis in the understanding and teaching of biogeochemical processes in natural ‘pristine’ systems at first, and have now broadened their approaches to agricultural and suburban settings as well. However, it is the environmental and ecological engineers who will change their profession to design and build better, more efficient treatment systems. For this reason, the next generations of environmental and ecological engineers need to be better equipped with fundamental knowledge in biogeochemistry. And yes, this might currently be somewhat outside their comfort zone. But these professionals or professionals to be have no choice but to acquire (and teach) these fundamentals to keep improving their professions. By nature, processes at play in treatment systems involve chemical, biological, microbiological, biochemical, physical, and hydrological processes just to name the main ones. Engineers must thus know enough of each of these core scientific domains to make sense of what they will observed in treatment systems. For example, ecological engineers use the natural denitrification process to remove excess nitrate from ground and surface waters. For ecological engineers to improve and optimize denitrification in treatment systems they design, they must recognize that the fuel for denitrification is organic matter, which quality matters very much. As such ecological engineers must understand the molecular makeshift of organic matter used by denitrifier microbes, how and where the energy is stored on the organic molecules themselves, why some organic matter is more ‘palatable’ to microbes than others, and what it is that we can do to provide the best quantity and quality of organic matter. Understanding and optimizing denitrification in man-made systems thus requires being able to draw from knowledge pools that are sometimes taught separately, from where the electrons are located on molecules to hydrological processes. It is possible that readers with strong biological background might find the biological facet of this book a bit short and simple. Just as well, non-engineers should not be afraid of ‘engineering’ in the title. The course is designed to provide the biogeochemical knowledge engineers might not have obtained in their curricula, and the quantitative knowledge non-engineers might not have been exposed to as well. Regardless, I do hope that environmental scientists, ecologists, and engineers alike, will find the integration of knowledge useful in this book. The physical objects used as foundation for this book include naturally occurring and human-designed pollutant filters, which may reduce excess nutrient concentrations and loads in rural and suburban environments. Systems reviewed include wetlands, riparian buffers and vegetated filter strips, woodchip bioreactors, streams, stormwater ponds and bioretention zones. This book uses excess nitrogen as the core parameter where the principles of biogeochemical processes are illustrated, and may apply to other fields of application. In summary, this book provides the fundamental necessary biogeochemical knowledge to answer these questions: How do wetlands, streams, riparian zones, woodchip bioreactors, and other ecologically-based treatment systems filter excess nutrient out of the aquatic environment? How can we as a society, or as ecological engineers and environmental scientists, use or better design treatment systems to filter out excess nutrients? 1.3 Biogeochemical processes in pollution flows This book is intrinsically related to the concept of pollution, the consequences of pollution, and what can be done about it. Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change (Wikipedia contributors 2018p). Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities, leading to degradation of aquatic ecosystems (Wikipedia contributors 2018j) The goals of environmental and ecological engineers and scientists are to reduce pollution, and in our case improve water quality. The concept of water pollution implies that there is a source of contamination, contaminants, and at the end, adverse consequences on aquatic ecosystems, on human health, but also at the economic level. It is interesting to realize that there is almost an infinite number of ‘pathways’ from a pollution source to its consequences. To place the field of application of the biogeochemical processes described in this book, one can take an example of a pathway from contaminants to consequences to illustrate the knowledge areas this book focuses on. The most spectacular events are usually reported in the press, which has been extremely instrumental in increasing the global awareness at all levels, and in many cases have triggered regulation changes. The most infamous case was when the Cuyahoga River repeatedly catching on fire near Cleveland caught the attention of the Time Magazine in 1969 (Latson 2015), eventually leading to the Clean Water Act in 1972 (Wikipedia contributors 2018o). Newspaper articles relating and explaining the causes and consequences of pollution are remarkable in many ways: they have a way to encapsulate much information, in simple and concise terms. Yet, to catch the reader’s attention, it is often necessary to introduce the concepts out of sequence, e.g., introducing the consequences of pollution first before presenting the causes. Since most scientists and engineers are pretty good visual learners, a complimentary approach to written articles can be visual objects telling the same story in a linear manner from the causes of pollution to their consequences. For this, I have created a simple template to derive such ‘pollution flow charts’ that can translate in a concize visual object most of the information detailed in a several page article. A list of symbols illustrating the important steps between the pollution cause(s) to its consequence(s) are proposed in Table 1.1 below. Table 1.1: List of symbols used to construct a pollution flow chart, which can visually describe pollutions from their sources to their consequences Illustrated Symbol shape Symbol shape Description Label shape list of all the Non Point Sources (NPS) and point sources (PS) Rectangle lists all the direct pollutants resulting from the source(s) Diamond vector(s) of the pollutant(s). Often several Rounded rectangle receiving air or water bodies.

In 2017, an article was written by Lisa W. Foderaro about the causes and consequences of dysfunctional septic tanks in Long Island, NY, USA. It takes the reader between 5 to 10 min to read the article. I let the reader do just that here. ‘Dead Rivers, Closed Beaches’: A Water Crisis on Long Island By LISA W. FODERARO MAY 8, 2017 OAKDALE, N.Y. — The Great South Bay, flanked by Fire Island and the South Shore of Long Island, once produced half the shellfish consumed in the United States, and supported 6,000 jobs in the early 1970s. Since then, the health of the bay has declined. Housing development meant more septic tanks depositing more nitrogen in the ground. The nitrogen flowed to rivers and the Great South Bay, leading to algae blooms. It depleted salt marshes that serve as fish habitat and suppressed oxygen levels. One result is that the shellfish industry has all but collapsed. The annual harvest of hard clams, for example, has fallen more than 90 percent since 1980. After sweeping legislation that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed in April, Suffolk County and other local governments in New York are hoping to deal with their aging — or absent — sewer lines, drinking water systems and other water infrastructure. The law, the Clean Water Infrastructure Act, allocates $2.5 billion to a variety of projects, as concerns about the safety of drinking water are growing. Across the United States, impressive gains in water quality were made in the decades after passage of the Clean Water Act of 1972. But courts have generally ruled that the federal law was designed to address surface water contamination, and are divided about its application to tainted groundwater. As a result, problems from industrial pollution and untreated sewage have persisted. The water quality problem is acute in Suffolk County. With 360,000 septic systems, Suffolk has roughly the same number as all of New Jersey. For years, nitrogen from leaky septic tanks has seeped into groundwater and eventually into rivers and bays. “What we have been doing for decades is just managing the decline of water quality,” said Steven Bellone, the Suffolk County executive. “Every water body is listed as impaired. We have dead rivers, closed beaches, harmful algal blooms. Before signing the law on Long Island in late April, Mr. Cuomo noted that a quarter of New York’s 610 sewage treatment plants were operating past their useful life. “We’re living off the legacy not of our parents but of our grandparents,” he said. The new state act, which spans five years, will among other things provide $1.5 billion in grants for water infrastructure improvements, $75 million in rebates to help homeowners replace septic systems and $110 million to protect land in watersheds. The money significantly expands a similar state infrastructure fund that over the last few years made $400 million available to communities. In addition to the new water infrastructure financing, the state budget allotted $40 million to build two sewer systems in business districts on the North Shore in Suffolk County. And there was $5 million for Suffolk County and the Center for Clean Water Technology at Stony Brook University to develop new methods of removing contaminants from drinking water. While it was one of the more significant investments to emerge from the state budget, some say it should be viewed as a down payment. Steve Englebright, a state assemblyman who heads the Environmental Conservation Committee, has said $80 billion to $100 billion is required to address the state’s aging water infrastructure. On Long Island, which is already grappling with hazardous waste at scores of active Superfund sites, the geology poses special challenges. With scant wastewater treatment, Suffolk County sits atop an aquifer that provides virtually all of its drinking water, and the sandy soil allows nitrogen to seep into it. Nassau County, just west of Suffolk, has many more homes using sewers than Suffolk, where 75 percent of the population relies on septic systems. The main reason that a county as populous as Suffolk has remained on septic systems, county officials say, is the legacy of the last attempt at installing a system — the infamous Southwest Sewer District. The sewer system, covering parts of the towns of Islip and Babylon, was eventually built. But the project, which started coming on line in 1981, became so mired in corruption, delays and cost overruns that it spooked future elected officials. “It was the biggest scandal in the county’s history,” Mr. Bellone said. “The appetite politically to do anything on this issue was nonexistent after that. It effectively killed sewering here for decades.” Suffolk County is eager to catch up to Nassau on wastewater treatment, but officials say new sewer systems are prohibitively expensive. One project on the drawing board, for instance, will cover about 8,200 parcels bordering four rivers that feed into the Great South Bay. The price tag is $383 million. Instead, the county’s strategy is to coax homeowners to replace antiquated septic tanks with high-tech “denitrification systems” — small units that cost more than older septic systems but remove most of the nitrogen from wastewater. Mr. Bellone said Suffolk hoped to tap the new state fund to help property owners acquire the systems. The same article can be summarized very efficiently in a pollution flow chart illustrated in Figure 1.1. The causes of this pollution are leaky and dysfunctional septic tanks. The results are that untreated nitrogen finds its way through the groundwater (GW), which is the vector in this article. The article mentions two receiving bodies: the bay and the aquifer. There are potential health risks associated with too much nitrogen added in the aquifer which serves as a drinking water supply (e.g., drinking water limit in the US for nitrate is 10 mg N/L). The article particularly insists on the fact that much of the excess nitrogen finds its way to rivers and end up in the Great South Bay, where algal blooms form. The consequences of the algal blooms are all linked to the depletion of oxygen generated from the large amount of organic matter decaying in the bay. The economic consequences are that the shellfish industry has all but collapsed. Figure 1.1: Pollution flow chart for the article ‘Dead Rivers, Closed Beaches’: A Water Crisis on Long Island, published in the New York Times, in May 2017 This book aims at providing enough details about the important steps of this and other pollution flow charts. In particular, this book aims at providing the necessary knowledge for environmental scientists and engineers to be able to describe with confidence the processes and the actors at play in a generic pollution chart. As such this book addresses the conditions that lead to algal blooms, and provides enough phycology knowledge to describe the major bloom forming groups. The book particularly insists on the biogeochemical processes associated with eutrophication, which are very close to the ones at play in treatment systems naturally existing or man-designed to reduce pollutant loads closest to their source (Figure 1.2) Figure 1.2: Target areas and processes for this class in the pollution flow chart for the article ‘Dead Rivers, Closed Beaches’: A Water Crisis on Long Island 1.4 Scope of this book The scope of this book is to provide an ‘horizontal’ view across disciplines going from electron orbitals to efficiency of man-made treatment systems in removing pollutants. For this, this book reviews and puts together into one ensemble the necessary knowledge from disciplines including chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, thermochemistry, modeling, and ecological engineering. The book first reviews the electron allocations on atoms and molecules, which are at the source of the generation and storage of energy in the biosphere. The book provides the necessary thermochemistry knowledge by introducing the notions of pH and pε and teaches how to draw pH-pε diagrams. The book presents the functioning of several treatment systems and uses wetlands as a teaching model where most of the biogeochemical processes important in ecological engineering are present. The book details in mathematical terms process kinetics and models often applied in ecological engineering. 1.5 Exercises The goal of the exercises below is to draw pollution flow charts from articles published in the press and to realize that there always are at least a contaminant source, a vector, a receiving body, and environmental and health consequences. Not all elements are necessarily reported in all press articles, but they generally are. Good luck! Exercise 1.1 Draw a pollution flow chart for the article published in the press below The first thing to do is to read the article carefully while idendifying the list of sources of pollution, the pollutants themselves, all the vectors of pollution listed in the article, whether receiving bodies are mentioned, whether bulk/macroscale and consequences are described, and list all the health, environmental, and economical consequences By The Editorial Board Oct. 25, 2016 North Carolina’s Noxious Pig Farms The landscape of eastern North Carolina is dotted with giant pools of bright pink sludge. These are waste lagoons, where industrial farms across the state dispose of billions of gallons of untreated pig urine and feces every year. The waste can carry E. coli, salmonella, cryptosporidium and other bacteria that can lead to serious illness or death if they spread to humans. After Hurricane Matthew deluged North Carolina this month, at least 14 of the lagoons flooded. Environmental advocates and state officials have been flying over regions to identify overflowing lagoons where floodwaters have become mixed with the waste, a public health hazard that could last for weeks as bacteria flow into rivers and streams, potentially sickening those who come into contact with those waters. Bacteria can also contaminate groundwater, the main source of drinking water for more than three million North Carolinians. Meanwhile, the nitrogen and phosphorus in hog waste can kill fish and damage ecosystems. State officials are now beginning to test rivers to assess the level of contamination. In states where hog farmers use waste lagoons, like North Carolina and Illinois, flooding is a serious hazard that may become more frequent as climate change leads to more severe storms. Even under normal conditions, lagoons can produce dangerous gases, noxious smells and dust containing hog waste. People living near these lagoons are at increased risk of asthma, diarrhea, eye irritation, depression and other health problems. A research program at North Carolina State University has found several safer waste-disposal methods, including one that converts nitrogen in waste into harmless nitrogen gas and uses another process to eliminate harmful bacteria. North Carolina took steps toward protecting its residents by passing a moratorium on new lagoons in 1997 and making it permanent in 2007. But around 4,000 lagoons constructed before 1997 remain in active use. Unless North Carolina and other states require agriculture companies to change their waste-disposal methods, what happened after Hurricane Matthew will happen again. .exo { font-family: \"arial\"; font-style: normal; padding-bottom: 30px; padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; background: #E6FAF0; } A possible flowchart for the article above is illustrated below. Notice that the macroscale consequences do not appear on the flowchart as the article does not really and clearly mention any. The article does mention three receiving bodies, and therefore the vectors are implied and have been added onto the flowchart. The health consequences of the water- and airborne pollutants are not the same, hence the two health consequence hearts on the flowchart. Obviously, there may be appreciation differences among people on how to draw a pollution flowchart, but overall the idea is to make appear as many of the vectors, receiving bodies and their consequences, and how they are linked together. Exercise 1.2 Draw a pollution flow chart for the article in the press below Florida Red Tide: Wildlife Advocate Stunned by Toll on Fish By The Associated Press Aug. 22, 2018 ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — The head of one of the U.S.’s largest environmental nonprofits says he was stunned Wednesday to see thousands of dead fish and devastation to other marine life from a red tide off hugging southwest Florida’s Gulf Coast. Collin O’Mara, the president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, went on Wednesday with a charter boat captain in waters off Southwest Florida coast in the Sanibel Island area. He reported thousands and thousands of dead fish, eels and horseshoe crabs in the Gulf of Mexico. He also saw the carcasses of six-foot-long Goliath grouper fish. “I was astounded by the level of carnage that we saw,” said O’Mara. “Of all the disasters I’ve seen in the past decade, this is probably the most visual.” The toxic algae bloom has overrun Florida’s southern Gulf Coast this summer. It’s hugging much of Florida’s peninsula, from Naples in the south to Bradenton some 150 miles north. Red tide is a natural occurrence that happens due to the presence of nutrients in salt water and an organism called a dinoflagellate. This bloom started in November. The last toxic bloom in the Gulf happened between 2004-2006. The algae bloom can cause breathing problems in some people, and because of the smell left behind by the dead fish, has cleared vacationers from some tourist areas. But the main impact has been on the wildlife, and experts are concerned. “It was actually pretty overwhelming being there,” said O’Mara, who also toured another part of the state on Wednesday to look at a different algae crisis. He visited areas affected by blue-green algae, which is in freshwater. Heavy May rains caused Lake Okeechobee to discharge water containing blue-green algae into rivers and canals. The bright green sludge oozed onto docks, dams and rivers. People often get the two algae confused, because they’re occurring simultaneously, and in some cases, in the same county. The red tide algae in the Gulf has killed at least 452 sea turtles, nearly 100 manatees, 11 dolphins and tons of fish. County maintenance crews have had to use backhoes to scoop up all the dead marine life on the beaches. Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in seven counties along Florida’s Gulf that have been overrun by the pungent bloom. He also ordered $1.5 million to be spent on various clean-up efforts and to help business impacted by dwindling tourists.

We have also seen that these three challenges are inter-connected and related. Nutrients and organic matter are related because the former contain the needed atoms necessary to build living cell and organism structures, corresponding to living organic matter, while the latter generally refers to dead organic matter and/or the assemblage of molecules which at one point were part of a living organism. This definition of the linkage between the two is hardly satisfying, however… When one looks at where the electrons are allocated on the important atoms, a much more unifying scheme appears. This chapter describes this unifying scheme. 2.1 The five fundamental requirements of life Before we dive down to the electron level, let us make sure we recognize that it is possible to simplify why there is, or not, life on our planet and the universe. At least five requirements appear fundamental for life to exist on our plant. Such a list includes: the presence of liquid water available nutrients that can fulfill the need for the six most numerous and important atoms that build most of our cell and organism structure: C, H, O, N, S, P. Without the commas comes this delightful acronym CHONSP which generations of students have come to love a source of energy, which in most cases is in the form of solar or chemical energy electrons acceptor(s), without which chemical energy cannot be released a suitable temperature range (about -5°C to +50°C) because of course most of living organisms will not live for very long outside this range There are many other requirements for life to occur, e.g., the ability to reproduce or even to die, but for what we are interested in, this is a satisfying list. In this chapter, we will address sources of energy and the secret that living organisms have found to store energy. Primary producers, which include most of chlorophyll containing plants from algae to angiosperms (flowering plants), have the ability to use solar radiations as a source of energy. An entire chapter is dedicated to this marvel. However, solar radiation cannot be the sole source of energy for primary producers, otherwise they would die at night… And for the rest of living organisms, solar radiation is just not a source of energy (merely a source of ‘bien-être’ or vitamin D for humans…!). So obviously, life has had to find a solution so that energy would be available for all conditions of light and temperature on earth. The first secret of life is the ability to store energy in the form of high energy electrons stored within organic molecules. Having a source of energy is always a good thing. However, energy can only be released if there is an outlet for it, otherwise it stays as potential energy. Practically, this means that the energy stored on organic molecules can and is only released when the electrons go from the high potential to a lower one, or in others words from electron donors (most of the time from organic molecules) to electron acceptors. This is the second secret of life on earth: on our planet exists this miracle molecule, O2, which acts as an extremely powerful electron acceptor. So you have to imagine O2 less as a gentle acceptor of electrons that organic matter would be kind enough to donate, but more like a very aggressive electron seeker and any organic matter located close to oxygen runs the risk to be oxidized, that is to lose its electrons. Sometimes, I like to refer to O2 as the electron kleptomaniac. So in oxygenated environments such as earth’s atmosphere and most water bodies, living organisms’ only concern is to have potential energy available in the form of high energy electrons stored onto organic molecules, because this energy can easily be released at any time thanks to the very oxidizing agent O2. Chapter 5 goes into the details of how this energy is released and transferred in cells. 2.2 Electron allocation onto CHONSP First, among the 6 atoms that form CHONSP, and this is true for all atoms except for noble gases which are stable monatomic atoms, none of them exist as monatomic atoms: they always form bonds with other atoms to form molecules. Among the CHONSP, three of them are homonuclear diatomic molecules, i.e., they can form molecules of two atoms of the same chemical element: H2 (dihydrogen, although it is most often referred to simply as hydrogen, which can be quite confusing), O2 (dioxygen, although oxygen is also most often used, unfortunately), and N2 (dinitrogen, which name is generally properly applied). Obviously, they can also bind to other elements, which is what we are about to see. If indeed, on our planet floats a very oxidizing agent in the form of O2, then the stable state of all other molecules should be where most of their elements have lost all their electrons to oxygen. And there ought to be techniques to see where the electrons are allocated on molecules. 2.3 Electronegativity as a powerful tool to allocate electrons Chemists have created the oxidation state (OS) or oxidation number indicator which quantifies this electron allocation to some extent, but at this stage, we find it to be rather confusing for our purpose of allocating or view where the electrons are Stored in molecules. More discussion and information on Oxidation State is available in the glossary of this book. Oxidation States are used extensively later on. We must first look in the electronegativity concept. Electronegativity is a chemical property which describes how well an atom can attract an electron to itself. In the periodic table in Figure 2.1, first observe that our CHONSP all belong to the non-metallic atoms. Figure 2.1: Vibrant Periodic Table With 118 Elements. Obtained freely from https://sciencenotes.org/periodic-table-pdf-2/ Second, all atoms are more or less electronegative. The most electronegative atom is F, fluorine. Electronegativity decreases towards the left and the bottom of the table as illustrated in Figure 2.2. For our CHONSP, ElecNegO &gt; ElecNegN &gt; ElecNegS &gt; ElecNegC &gt; ElecNegH &gt; ElecNegP. Figure 2.2: Periodic table of the elements with electronegativities shown. Obtained freely from https://sciencenotes.org/list-of-electronegativity-values-of-the-elements/ If you look carefully in Figure 2.2 and in equation (2.1), you will see that the electronegativity of oxygen is 3.44, which is a lot greater than that of N (3.04), and the difference between N and C and S, is about 0.5. In other words, all the CHNSP stand no chance next to O: in any molecule which may involve CHNSP, the O atom will attract the electrons to itself. \\[\\begin{align} O \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; N \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; S \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; C \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; H \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; P \\\\ 3.44 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 3.05 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.58 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.56 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.30 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.19 \\tag{2.1} \\end{align}\\] The electronegativity numbers give an estimation of how much the electrons will be pulled towards the more electronegative atom compared to the less electronegative one, sometimes creating some polarization of the molecule. Here we use this concept a little further and allocate all the electrons to the more electronegative atom. This is admitedly artificial and, again, in reality electrons are shared and electronegativity only describes the tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons towards itself. However, allocating electrons using the electronegativity as a basis is an extremely powerful tool to visualize where electrons are and whether and how much energy is stored on organic matter. For example, in the H2O molecule, one can see in the Lewis dot Structure below that by allocating the electrons based on electronegativity, the O atom has all the electrons for itself, while the 2 H, have none for themselves. Let us make sure that there is no confusion between the octet rule and the electronegativity as applied here. Atoms assemble into molecules so that their octet rules be fulfilled. So in the H2O molecule, yes each H shares an electron with the O and reciprocally. But, allocating the electrons using the electronegativity as detailed above tells us which atom really has the electrons for itself. And that atom is O. Figure 2.3: Electrons allocated to the oxygen atom on the water molecule using electronegativity as a guide for allocation. This shows that oxygen keeps all 8 electrons for itself, while the hydrogen atoms have lost their electron We realize that the electron allocation can be quite confusing or a bit artificial at first, but we shall see in Chapter 8 that it is fully corroborated with oxidation and reduction processes. You can now see in equation (2.1), that sulfur and carbon nearly have the same electronegativity, which is one of the reasons for the ease of formation of the disulfur bridges in proteins. Also notice that phosphorus has the lowest electronegativity of our CHONSP, and this is the reason why, as we shall see later, phosphorus stays in the oxidized form, even in organic molecules. 2.4 Dioxygen: the ‘electron kleptomaniac’ molecule Oxygen is a homonuclear diatomic molecule, which means that it can form the diatomic molecule O2. The two atoms of Oxygen, having the same electronegativity, split the electrons, which means that each atom has 6 electrons for itself as shown in Figure 2.4. So if we summarize things, we have the most electronegative atom in the universe after Fluorine (Figure 2.2) that is floating in most places on earth and in water, essentially in a state (O2) where it really would rather have 8 rather than 6 electron for itself! This is the reason why oxygen is the ultimate electron acceptor, although a better representation might be to describe it as the ultimate ‘electron kleptomaniac’. Figure 2.4: Electrons equally allocated to each O atom on the dioxygen molecule, i.e., each oxygen atom has 6 electrons for itself But let us be clear: the oxygen atom can only be an electron acceptor if it does not have 8 electrons for itself. The only two possibilities are in the case of O2, for which each atom as 6 electrons for itself, and the other possibility is for hydrogen peroxide \\(H-O-O-H\\), where each oxygen atom have 7 electrons for themselves. Because oxygen is the most electronegative atom (after fluorine), in all other molecules where it is involved, oxygen will have 8 electrons for itself, and can therefore never accept more electrons. This is the first time that this concept is presented in this book, but not the last, and the earlier the reader fully digests this information, the better. Again, and I purposely repeat here, in all other molecules where the oxygen atom is involved, oxygen will have 8 electrons for itself, and can therefore never accept more electrons. As a result, in organic molecules, the electrons allocated to oxygen are never available to be donated and should never be counted as stored electrons. 2.5 Fully Oxidized forms of CNSP On our planet, we are lucky to ‘bathe’ in an oxidized environment, which means among other things, that the oxygen atom will tend to attract all the electrons for itself during interaction with CHNSP. Another way to look at it is to say that the stable state in an aerobic environment of the CHNSP atoms corresponds to molecules where the CHNSP atoms will have zero electrons for themselves (because oxygen stole them). In this case, we say that these atoms are fully oxidized, litterally, that oxygen has stolen all electrons from them. The action of losing electrons is referred to as oxidation by analogy. Reversely, an atom that has 8 electrons for itself is referred to as fully reduced, and the action of gaining electrons is called reduction. Although the terms were initially used to describe reactions with oxygen, losing or gaining electrons does not involve oxygen only, and the words oxidation (losing electrons) and reduction (gaining electrons) apply to any other atoms. Well, and guess what, there are not that many possible molecular configurations for which CNSP are fully oxidized, in fact only one for inorganic molecules with a single C, N, S, or P atom in them! In Figure 2.5 below, you can see that none of the CNSP atoms have electrons for themselves: they have all been taken by the oxygen atoms! Figure 2.5: Electron allocation on each of the C, N, S, and P atoms for the CO2, nitrate, sulfate, and phosphate molecules, showing that C, N, S, and P atoms have zero electrons for themselves, or are fully oxidized, while Oxygen has 8, or is fully reduced As a result, these molecules are deemed as stable in an aerobic environment. This suggests that all other molecules containing CNSP are essentially unstable on our planet…?! Yes, you read it correctly, that is the case! Honestly, there is nothing new really as this has been written a long time ago, e.g., in the first book of the Hebrew Bible or the Christian Old Testament “you are dust and to dust you will return” (Gn 3:19). So we essentially have a reprieve on this planet, but so do all living creatures!! The secret of life has been to be able to create and maintain CNSP atoms with electron for themselves, very well ‘knowing’ that these electrons would eventually be stripped away by O2, but living organisms take advantage of this because the transfer of electrons generates energy (see Chapter 5). Notice that the suffix of the oxidized forms of N, S, and P, is -ate. The exception appears to be CO2, which is a gas while the -ate molecules are dissolved ions. However, the ionic forms of dissolved CO2 are bicarbonate and carbonate, which have the suffix -ate. So everything is logical in the end. To be complete, all the fully oxidized forms of CNSP may lose or gain protons (H+) depending on the pH. It turns out that for the pH range encountered in most natural waters (3.5 &lt; pH &lt; 9), only the carbonates and the phosphates may have different molecular formulae. So the fully oxidized forms of C in inorganic molecules are illustrated in Figure 2.6 below (additional details available in the glossary): Figure 2.6: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of C, including from left to right CO2, carbonic acid, hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate), and carbonate, showing that the C atoms have zero electrons for themselves The fully oxidized forms of P in inorganic molecules are illustrated in Figure 2.7 below (additional details available in the glossary): Figure 2.7: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of P, including from left to right Phosphoric acid, dihydrogen Phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, and phosphate , showing that the P atoms have zero electrons for themselves 2.6 Oxidation versus Reduction But if O2 wants electrons so badly from any atom, how come all living creatures do not just turn into ‘dust’, i.e., carbon dioxide, nitrate, sulfate and phosphate, all the time or manage to live at all?? A minimum ‘energy obstacle’ must be overcome for electrons to be transferred: this is referred to as the activation energy (see Chapter 5). This obstacle is overcome during combustion: the high temperature of a flame self-propagates the transfer of electrons from organic matter to O2. Chapter 5 provides in great detail how living organisms manage to allow enough transfer of electrons to generate energy, without turning into ‘dust’ at once like in combustion. Yet, when an organism dies, all the electrons stored onto the organic molecules are eventually taken by oxygen in an aerobic environment. We have now established that oxygen eventually takes all electrons, but for that to happen, a minimum energy obstacle must be overcome. This opens the possibility for CNSP to, at least temporarily, have electrons for themselves. This also opens the possibility to an infinite number of possible combinations of CHONSP assemblages in nature. Before we get there though, it is time to repeat some important terms. The word oxidation comes from the early days of chemistry referring to reactions where oxygen was involved, and in reality ‘stole’ electrons from other atoms. We now know that oxygen is not necessarily the only one involved in loss of electrons. By extention, any atom which loses electrons, not necessarily to O2, is said to be oxidized. Conversely, an atom which gains electrons is said to be reduced or to undergo reduction. This term also comes from the early days of chemistry when Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794) observed that the weight of a heated metallic ore diminished due to the loss of dioxygen as a gas; and the metallic ore appeared reduced in size and in weight (Wikipedia contributors 2018f). We now know that this corresponds to the acquisition of electrons, hence the word reduction for the gain of electrons. Several mnemonics exist in English to associate electron loss/gain with oxidation/reduction: LEO (Loss of Electrons is Oxidation) the lion says GER (Gain of Electrons is Reduction)! OIL RIG: Oxidation Is Loss (of electrons) Reduction Is Gain (of electrons) When oxygen takes electrons from another atom, we say that oxygen has been reduced, while the other atom has been oxidized. An oxidation is necessarily accompanied with a reduction, as electrons do not ‘float’ in solution like protons do. When the CNSP atoms have lost all their electrons like in Figure 2.5, we say that the CNSP atoms are fully oxidized. Fully reduced atoms have 8 electrons for themselves, as is the case for oxygen in carbon dioxide (and carbonates), nitrate, sulfate, and phosphates. This suggests that between fully oxidized and fully reduced, there might be cases where atoms are partially oxidized and reduced. 2.7 A gradient of oxidation and reduction states on inorganic and organic molecules The number of electrons (1, 2, etc. up to 8) the CNSP atoms have for themselves dictates the atomic makeshift of molecules or molecular radicals. It is now time to define what organic vs. inorganic molecules are. The term organic molecule finds its roots in vitalism, where it was believed that the elements entering in the composition of living organisms had to be different to the ones that made inanimate things. The term organic has remained, and a more modern definition is that an organic molecule is a molecule where there is at least one \\(C-C\\) bond. The best definition of an inorganic molecule is a molecule that is not organic. One of the most important things to understand and learn in this part is that it is the electron allocation which essentially defines what a molecule will be. For example, molecules such as carbon dioxide CO2 and methane CH4 are quite different, one involves oxygen, the other hydrogen atoms. But in reality, one can make sense of the difference by looking at how many electrons the C has for itself. When C has zero electrons for itself, this means that some other atoms have stolen all the electrons from C, and there are not that many possibilities out there. It could theoretically be all atoms that have higher electronegativity such as O,N, and S. And all three are theoretically possible. However, the only stable solution in an aerobic environment is O=C=O or CO2, carbon dioxide, and the carbonates (Figure 2.6). For the record, among the other theoretical possibilities, there are other inorganic molecules that exist out there for which C has zero electrons for itself, which include at least: cyanate (N≡C-O-), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), S=C=S (CS2 carbon disulfide) and O=C=S (OCS, carbonyl sulfide) (Carroll et al. 1986; Notholt et al. 2003; Campbell et al. 2008; Ogée et al. 2016), and also guanidinium (C(NH2)3+), all of which exist in minute quantities in nature. So, for environmental and ecological applications, it is fair to say that the ‘only’ carbon-based inorganic molecules with zero electrons are CO2 and the carbonates. Reversely, the only molecule containing one C atom with 8 electrons for itself is a molecule where all the other atoms bound to the C atom give their electrons away. The only atom that will do this is hydrogen, so the only possible molecule with a C atom is methane CH4. Thus, CO2 is an example of a molecule in which carbon is fully oxidized (lost all its electrons), while CH4 is a molecule in which carbon is fully reduced (gained all possible 8 electrons). In other words, it is quite interesting to look at molecules from the stand point of the number of electrons atoms have for themselves and speculate on the different possibilities of molecules. Obviously, the examples of CO2 and CH4 are simplistic because they are simple, inorganic molecules. Two other simple examples but that of fully oxidized and reduced molecular “pairs” with relevance to matter very much in our field, are nitrate (NO3-) vs. ammonium (NH4+), and sulfate (SO42-) vs. hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Identifying which of the molecules in the pair is more oxidized or reduced is simple. For fully oxidized compounds, the central atom of interest (e.g. S or N) must have no electrons to itself by definition. This electron deficiency must be caused by the presence of an atom more electronegative than the central atom. We might (correctly) guess then, that the fully oxidized form of S or N is attached to the “ultimate electron acceptor” oxygen. So, the fully oxidized versions of S and N are sulfate (SO42-) and nitrate (NO3-) respectively. Conversely, hydrogen-containing NH4+ and H2S are the fully reduced forms of N and S. This is because hydrogen, the least electronegative of CHONSP, “provides” electrons to N or S (Table 2.1). Overall, across organic and inorganic molecules, there is an entire gradient of number of electrons allocated on the C, N, and S (Table 2.1). Notice that I purposely omitted to mention P here, because the only form of P relevant for environmental and ecological engineering are the phosphates. And we have seen that in the phosphate molecules, P always has zero electrons for itself. It is therefore always in an oxidized form (Figure 2.7). Table 2.1 summarizes a gradient of electron allocations, or a gradient of oxidation and reduction states, on the CNSP atoms. It is important to notice several things: Carbon is the only atom with a variable number of electrons in organic molecules N and S always have 8 electrons for themselves in organic molecules This suggests that carbon is quite a variable of adjustment for electron ‘acquisition’ and ‘donation’ This is why the first step of photosynthesis stores electrons on the C atom rather than on any other atom Because C can be stripped of its electrons a lot easier than N or S, the latter will just not give their electrons in an environment where C can do that for them first. As a result, and this is crucial for our field, the inorganic byproducts containing C, N, or S of the oxidation of organic matter in respiration (details in Chapter 5) are CO2, where carbon has been fully oxidized, and NH4+ and H2S, where N and S are still fully reduced, as they do not get oxidized during heterotrophic respiration. Notice that N and S only have variable numbers of electrons in inorganic molecules. The N atom of nitrite has two electrons for itself and is highly unstable in aerobic environments as oxygen will try to steal its electrons. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfite (SO32-) also are in very small quantities in the atmosphere (SO2) or in water as HSO3- (not represented in Table 2.1) and SO32-, as both will readily be oxidized in sulfuric acid and sulfate. Notice that N2 has 5 electrons for itself, which is quite a lot and, therefore, potentially is an important electron donor. However, the triple bond N≡N is very difficult to break and O2 does not, even at high temperatures. As a result, N≡N is an inert or unreactive gas, although it makes for about 78% of earth’s atmosphere. Nitrogen in N2 is thus referred to as unreactive nitrogen.

Let us take the example of glucose. Glucose is the result molecule of photosynthesis, where electrons have been stored onto the carbon atoms, which originally contained none as the nutrient from which glucose molecule is assembled is CO2. How can one see this? In the equation (2.2), the half reactions for the production of glucose! Additional details on redox half-reactions are provided in the glossary. What is important to see here is that: 24 electrons are necessary to built glucose from CO2 that these 24 electrons originally come from the oxygen atom of H2O that as oxygen atoms from water lose electrons, they form O2, where each atom has only 6 electrons for itself (Figure 2.4) \\[\\begin{align} 6\\,CO_2 + 24\\,H^+ + 24\\,e^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\\,H_2O\\\\ 12\\,H_2O &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; 6\\,O_2 + 24\\,H^+ + 24\\,e^-\\\\ &amp; &amp;\\\\ \\hline\\\\ 6\\,CO_2 + 6\\,H_2O &amp; \\to &amp; C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\\,O_2 \\tag{2.2} \\end{align}\\] After what we have said about oxygen and its propensity to steal all electrons, why would it suddenly give electrons to C to form glucose? Indeed, there is some magic involved and it is called photosynthesis! For this to happen, magic catalysts must be able to steal the electrons from oxygen of H2O, and a lot of energy captured in the form of light is necessary! And indeed in the end, thanks to the electron allocation concept, it is possible to visualize where all electrons on the glucose molecule are located as illustrated in Figure 2.8. Figure 2.8: Electron allocation on the glucose molecule showing that the C atoms have 3 to 5, and an average of 4 electrons for themselves So, hopefully you are now convinced thanks to both the equations and Figure 2.8 that indeed electrons are stored onto organic molecules! Notice that four of the C atoms have 4 electrons for themselves, while one has 3 and the last one has 5. On average though, each atom has 4. This actually is quite interesting as it corresponds to the number of electrons C has on its free form. This means that photosynthesis is not ‘trying’ to store more electrons than what it has in its free form: this is probably a lot more efficient than if it tried to store 6 like for the lipids (see Table 2.1 and Chapter 4), and yet provides an opportunity to store a lot of electrons. Let us take another example with cysteine, which has N and S atoms in it in addition to C and O atoms. You can see in Figure 2.9 that the N and S atoms have 8 electrons for themselves, while the C atoms have 1, 4 and 5 electrons for themselves. Cysteine has thus stored a total of 28 electrons on a total of 5 CNS atoms or 40% more electrons per atom than glucose. Figure 2.9: Electron allocation on the cysteine molecule showing the number of electrons stored on the C, N and S atoms An alga who would use nitrate, sulfate and bicarbonates as its nutrients to anabolize cysteine, would need to find 28 electrons and energy to assemble cysteine, as no electrons come with the nutrients listed here. Interestingly, the electrons stored on N and S in cysteine are not useful as a source of electrons in the respiration chain of heterotrophic respiration. But the N and S atoms, which respectively appear as amine (-NH2) and thiol (-SH) radicals for cysteine in Figure 2.9, play a central role in molecular configuration . This is what the next chapter is going to show. The last example is ATP (Adenosine TriPhosphate), illustrated in Figure 2.10. You can see that there are lots of red dots on the triphosphate side of the molecule, and see that phosphorus has zero electrons for itself…! Chapter 5 details the reasons how and why ATP carries energy. But here, one can see that surely, it is not thanks to electrons on P, since there are none! The triphosphate chain is bound to a ribose, itself bound to an adenine. Ribose + Adenine is called adenosine. On ribose, each carbon stores an average of 4 electrons, like all carbohydrates. There are lots of electrons stored on the 5 atoms of nitrogen on adenine (5 × 8 = 40). But these are not used for generating energy in the respiration chain. Instead, the large number of N atoms and electrons allow for electronic resonance on the adenine side, which makes it flat and very strong and very resistant to degradation. The number of electrons packed in a very resistant molecule must be put in relation with the high value of the ATP molecule. Figure 2.10: Electron allocation on the ATP molecule showing the number of electrons stored on the C (1 to 4), N (always 8), and P (always 0) atoms Last but important point. It is possible that some of you are still wondering why the electrons on oxygen are not counted as the number of electrons stored on molecules, and particularly on organic molecules. Most oxygen atoms, outside of the O2 molecule, have already ‘stolen’ electrons from all other atoms, as we have now repeated quite a few times. So when these molecules are anabolized from molecules such as carbonate, nitrate, sulfate or phosphate, each oxygen atom is already loaded with 8 electrons. So, it cannot accept any additional ones. So each oxygen atom in organic and inorganic molecule, is not bringing any electron ‘to the table’. The only changes can occur on the C, N, and S atoms. 2.9 Summary on electron allocations This concludes the chapter on electron allocation, and the first introduction to oxidation and reduction. We have learned that using the electron allocation rooted in the electronegativity concept, it is possible to visualize where the electrons are stored and realize that in the vast majority of the time: Oxygen ‘steals’ all electrons for itself and is fully reduced, unless it is in the form of O2, where it becomes very ‘hungry’ for electrons Hydrogen being less electronegative, always ‘gives’ its electron to CONS atoms Life’s secret to storing energy boils down to having high-energy electrons stored on C, N, and S atoms, although only the C atoms easily accept or donate electrons. Phosphorus almost always remains in the fully oxidized forms of phosphates (or polyphosphates), even when incorporated in organic molecules as we shall see in the next chapter. This is due to the fact that phosphorus’ electronegativity is lower than that of hydrogen. Phosphate plays a crucial role in energy conveyance, however, thanks to the diphospho anhydride bond. The next step consists in presenting where and why organisms need N, S, and P, to build their structure. The next chapter presents the four molecular families with which all organisms, and therefore organic matter, are assembled.

Looking at these molecules may be a bit scary at first glance: lots of CHONSP everywhere, sometimes linear molecules, sometimes in cycle… No worries, though, the goal of this chapter is to provide the keys to recognize some of the key features of these molecules. Once this is recognized, things can make a lot more sense. And yes, it is important to be able to draw some of these molecules. In reality, there are about half a dozen to learn by heart, and all the other ones can be derived from them for our purposes here. In the previous chapter, we were able to allocate electrons to CHONSP atoms, depending on the bonds together. We realized that oxygen had the central role and essentially was able to take all electrons from any other atoms bonded to it. There are about a dozen functional groups of biochemical significance that are important to recognize. Most of them involve different possibilities of bonds between C and O. Why do we care? Functional groups are associated with chemical and physical properties that make organisms be strong, or rather flexible, attract or repulse water, store or release energy. That is why. 3.1 Hydrocarbon chains First of all, just about all life biochemistry is based on the carbon atom chains. This is where everything starts. It makes a lot of sense because you will discover later that indeed, life uses carbon atoms to store and release energy. So carbon atoms have 4 valence electrons. They can ‘gain’ electrons if they bind with hydrogen atoms, can share electrons when they bind together, or lose their electrons when bonded to O, N, or S. The basis of the organic chemistry needed in ecological and environmental engineering is hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are organic compounds consisted entirely of C and H atoms. 3.1.1 Alkanes Alkanes nomenclature is at the basis of all the naming of organic molecules. Just about all functional groups are essentially variations from the alkane skeleton. They are classified depending on the number of carbons constituting their atom chain, and their chain is always saturated with hydrogen. Saturated with hydrogen? What does this mean? It first means that all bonds are single σ bonds, and second, that valence electrons of the carbon not used for C-C bonds, are shared with the one valence electron of hydrogen atoms to make C-H bonds. This also means that when a carbon chain is saturated with hydrogen, the carbon atoms have all the electrons for themselves. In other words, alkanes or alkane like hydrocarbon chains are the molecules that store the most electrons. Some hydrocarbon chains are called unsaturated when between two carbons, two valence electrons are shared between carbon atoms to form a double or even triple π bond. Each of the two carbons involved are thus called unsaturated with hydrogen. Many commercials in the western world are advertising food with unsaturated fat (Figure 3.1): it just means that some carbons of the hydrocarbon chains of the lipids in the food are unsaturated! But we will discover this a little later. Figure 3.1: Food containing unsaturated fats, reputed to be healthier. obtained at https://healthbeat.spectrumhealth.org/healthy-fats-for-healthy-blood-lipids/ Back to our alkanes. The simplest alkane is methane, made of one carbon atom. Four hydrogen are necessary to fulfill its octet rule and to saturate its carbon (Figure 3.2). Figure 3.2: Lewis dot structure for methane The final formula for methane is thus CH4. The second simplest alkane is ethane, made of two carbon atoms bonded together using two of their valence electrons to make a covalent bond. Hydrogen atoms form bonds with the three valence electrons left on each of the carbon atoms, for a final formula of C2H6, or a condensed formula of CH3-CH3 (Figure 3.3). Figure 3.3: Lewis dot structure for ethane The third simple alkane is propane, made of three carbon atoms in an open chain. The central carbon is bonded to the outer carbons and only has two valence electrons available to bond with H, or for the central carbon to be saturated with hydrogen (Figure 3.4). The final formula of propane is C3H8, or its condensed formula is CH3-CH2-CH3. Figure 3.4: Lewis dot structure for propane The fourth simple alkane is butane (C4H10) with four carbons in its saturated open chain. The two central atoms are saturated with two hydrogen atoms to form a condensed formula of CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3, or CH3-(CH2)2-CH3. The list goes on and on as adding a carbon consists in adding a -CH2- in the middle of the previous chain and in the formula. The general formula for alkanes is thus CnH2n+2. The ‘+2’ in the formula corresponds to the third H on each of the end carbons. In English, Mary Eats Peanut Butter is used as a mnemonic to remember the first four alkanes, as each first letter is the first letter of the respective alkanes. For longer chains, the Greek prefixes are used: pentane (5), hexane (6), heptane (7), octane (8), nonane (9), decane (10), dodecane (12), tetradecane (14), hexadecane (16), octadecane (18), eicosane (20), and docosane (22) to stop there. Table 3.1 summarizes some of the formulae and representations of alkanes. Table 3.1: Alkanes from methane to hexane with condensed and structural formulae, and skeletal structure Number of C and formula Prefix Alkane name and condensed formula Structural formula Skeletal or Line structure 1 CH4 meth- methane CH4 2 C2H6 eth- ethane CH3-CH3 3 C3H8 prop- propane CH3-CH2-CH3 4 C4H10 but- butane CH3-(CH2)2-CH3 5 C5H12 pent- pentane CH3-(CH2)3-CH3 6 C6H14 hex- hexane CH3-(CH2)4-CH3 Looking inside Table 3.1, it now appears that the same molecule can be represented in several ways. First the formula, in the first column where the number of atoms are compiled and added as a subscript near each atom. It is concise, but gives no information on how the atoms are structured together. In the third column, the condensed formula gives more information on how the hydrogen atoms are assembled relative to the carbon atoms. In the propane example, CH3-CH2-CH3 suggests that three hydrogen atoms are bonded to the end carbons, and two H are bonded to the central carbon. By convention, since the hydrogen can only make one bond, it is implied that in CH3-CH2, the hyphen ‘-’ represents the bond between carbons. The structural formula provides a comprehensive illustration of all the bonds and all the atoms. But in organic chemistry, there are so many C and H atoms, that the structural formula becomes too crowded and not easily readable. Chemists have thus decided to simplify the formula representations as much as possible. One very common simplification is the Skeletal structure or line structure representation, illustrated in the fifth column of Table 3.1. As its names suggest, only the carbon skeleton is kept and the rest is implied. Butane for example in Table 3.1 and Figure 3.5 is represented as three angled line segments. It is implied that at the end of each segment, there is a carbon atom, and that each carbon is saturated with hydrogen. The zigzagging of the skeletal structure is also supposed to represent a little bit better how the atoms are thought to actually be intricate together. Actually, if you refer to the summary on electron orbitals, you will see that in alkyl chains, the carbons orbitals are in the sp3 hybridization form, which involves tetraedral shapes, hence the zigzaging. Additionally, because of the sp3 hybridization, the electrons are at their highest energy level! This should ring a bell and confirm that the secret of life to store energy is to store high energy electrons onto organic matter, and precisely onto C, N, and S atoms! All this might appear confusing at the beginning, but this is extremely logical, and helps tremendously when writing or reading molecules important to life and ecological engineering. Figure 3.5: Illustration of the assumptions associated with the correspondence between skeletal structure and structural formula for butane Alkanes provide the basis or skeleton of all other nomenclatures of environmentally relevant organic chemistry. Functional groups correspond in many cases to modifications of the -CH3 or -CH2- where one or several hydrogen atoms are replaced by other atoms, and in other cases to the bonds between two simpler molecules. But before we get there, it is important to address some other important hydrocarbons. 3.1.2 Unsaturated hydrocarbons So what about unsaturated hydrocarbons? As stated before, unsaturated implies that between two carbons, two valence electrons are shared between carbon atoms to form a double or triple π bond. For the majority of the cases of interest for this book, there is only one double bond in the unsaturated hydrocarbon open chains. In this case, the suffix for the molecule name is changed. Instead of -ane for the alkanes, it becomes -ene for what is referred to as the alkenes. In the example of Figure 3.6, the dehydrogenation of carbons 1 and 2 leads to the formation of but-1-ene or α butylene. Figure 3.6: Butene corresponds to the dehydrogenation of butane If you read correctly, you just saw yet another nomenclature for the name. It turns out that 1) where the double bond is located matters very much for the molecule property, and 2) the steric configuration (where the atoms are in space relative to each other) can change dramatically as the double bond is rather rigid, and the atoms are not nearly as free to rotate around the π bond as they are with a σ bond (details in Appendix A). As a result, there are really three possible forms of butene (Figure 3.7). Figure 3.7: The three butene isomers, respectively A: but-1-ene or α butylene,; B: (Z)-but-2-ene or cis-β-butylene; C: (E)-but-2-ene or trans-β-butylene This is honestly outside of the scope of this book, but Figure 3.7 caption points several new nomenclatures. The ‘1’ and ‘2’ in but-1-ene and but-2-ene, and the α and β respectively point to the carbon number that has a double bond. All carbon atoms are given an ordinate number in a hydrocarbon chains (further details later). Then isomers B and C in Figure 3.7 differ by the sides on which the two end -CH3 (referred to as a radical because it is bonded to another carbon, and this radical name is methyl, as it is based on methane that would have lost a hydrogen) are located. The methyl groups are either together, or Zusammen in German, or cis, i.e., on the same side in Latin, or, they are on opposite sides, or Entgegen in German, or trans, i.e., on the other side in Latin. The term butylene is still used today as it is inherited from the French butylène. Unsaturated hydrocarbon chains are rather present in lipids, but also in aromatic hydrocarbons. In the end, saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon chains are referred to as aliphatic hydrocarbons, as opposed to aromatic hydrocarbons. A second family of unsaturated hydrocarbon chains are the alkynes where there is a triple bond between two consecutive carbons. Honestly, this is extremely uncommon in biochemistry of life. The one rather famous molecule is acetylene, which is otherwise named ethyne, i.e., it is a two carbon chain with a triple bond (Table 3.6). 3.1.3 Aromatic hydrocarbons Aromatic hydrocarbons or arenes are cyclic hydrocarbon chains that, as the suffix -ene implies, have at least one double bond between two carbons, but in reality have two or three double bonds. And a hydrocarbon chain with generally alternate single and double bonds that is aromatic is thus called an arene. Aromatic hydrocarbons are ring-shaped, have planar or flat structures, and are considered to be structurally strong molecules and difficult to hydrolyze. Many of these molecules have an aroma or specific odors, hence the name aromatic. The strength and stability of these molecules is at the center of the stiffness of wood thanks to the lignin molecules, which contain lots of aromatic radicals. The following describes in details what at the electron orbital scale causes the aromatic hydrocarbons to have such structural stability. The quintessential model of the aromatic hydrocarbons of concern in biochemistry of life is the benzene ring. It has 6 carbons, with three double bonds, which implies that each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and is unsaturated with hydrogen and thus only has one hydrogen (Figure 3.8). Figure 3.8: Two different resonance forms of benzene (top) combine to produce an average structure (bottom). By Edgar181 - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2962329 Applying the Steric Number (SN) rule described here, SN for each carbon can be calculated as SN = (2 Carbon atoms + 1 hydrogen atom), or SN = 3. This suggests that the electron orbitals for each of the carbon atom are likely hybridized into sp2. This means that each carbon makes a σ bond with the two neighbor carbons, and with the hydrogen atom. This leaves essentially 6 p orbitals that can form double bonds as illustrated in Figure 3.8, or more likely a delocalisation of these electrons into a ring as represented in Figure 3.8. The molecular orbital theory suggests that alternating single and double bonds creates what is referred to as a conjugated pi bond system across multiple atoms, lowers the energy and stabilizes the molecule. Figure 3.9: Benzene sp2 and p orbitals delocalization. Orbital drawning after Vladsinger, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7531044 For the reasons described above, aromatic molecules are very stable, and do not break apart easily to react with other substances. Many of the aromatic rings in biological systems are based on the benzene ring, to which some of the hydrogens have been replaced by -OH, -CH3, etc. In benzene, each of the carbon atoms has 5 electrons for itself, slightly less than the 6 or 7 electrons available on carbons of the alkane molecules. Five electrons is more than the average carbohydrate carbon (4), and should theoretically be rather ‘attractive’ to energy releasing processes such as microbiological respiration. However, the delocalization of the p orbitals makes this molecule very stable and very difficult to break apart, and therefore rather ‘unattractive’ instead for energy release purposes, but extremely attractive for structural strength ones. Etymology Corner The word benzene comes from the German word benzin coined by Mitscherlich in 1833 (Mitscherlich 1833) from the benzoin resin. This is a dried exudation from pierced bark of trees of the genus Styrax (Styracaceae) mostly native from East and Southeast Asia (Sumatra, Java, Thailand), and used in perfumes, some kinds of incense, as a flavoring, and medicine (Wikipedia contributors 2019b). Benzoin resin is known from European pharmacists and perfumers since the 15th century. The word benzoin seems to be an oral transcription into German of the Arabic Lubān jāwī (لبان جاوي), which translates into Javan Frankincense (Wikipedia contributors 2019b), suggesting that the Arabs have known and traded this resin for a long time, along with many other types of Frankincense. To make things more complete and possibly confusing, the French chemist Auguste Laurent, named the same benzene substance phène in reference to the Greek word φαινω which means ‘I light’ as this substance was obtained from gases used for street lighting (Laurent 1836). This is the reason for the word phenol otherwise referred to as hydroxy-benzene and for the radical -phenyl, phenols, and phenolics described in this book. Historically, it seems that the naming in French was a bit of a political stence against the naming in German. Indeed the frictions between the French and the Germans were mounting at that time. Politics always play a role…! It turns out that in addition to purely hydrocarbon arenes, there are aromatic compounds with other atoms than just C and H, that are derived from benzene, and are non-benzene based. They are referred to as heteroarenes or heterocyclic compounds. In simple rings, there tend to be 5 to 6 atom rings where most of the atoms are carbons. It is not possible to avoid these because they play a crucial role in the chemistry of life, particularly for RNA and DNA. The rules for aromaticity are described in details by Hückel’s rules, but for this book, one should remember that aromatic compounds are cyclic, planar, and have delocalized π orbitals which gives them strength and stability. Figure 3.10: Homoarene benzene and three heteroarenes or heterocyclic hydrocarbons, including pyrimidine, imidazole, the combination of both forming purine. (with the H added, top, and without the H, bottom) Notice in Figure 3.10 that it is implied that there is a lone pair of electrons not part of any covalent bond for the nitrogen atoms. Each nitrogen atom must always have three bonds in organic molecules. Replacing two of the benzene carbons with nitrogen atoms yields pyrimidine. Additions of simple radicals and functional groups to this molecule is at the basis of the nitrogenous bases named pyrimidines used in the RNA and DNA. Removing a carbon from pyrimidine yields imidazole, and combining a pyrimidine with an imidazole yields a purine. And yes, purines are the other types of nitrogenous bases used in the RNA and DNA. Important aromatic molecules indeed! Do it yourself! Before you get bored because there is just too much to read, it is time to practice and draw molecules and functional groups on your own! Functional groups are introduced in the sections below. We are lucky to have online access to great tools that make drawing molecules playful. The tool I propose to use is called JSME, standing for JavaScript Molecule Editor (Bienfait and Ertl 2013). It is maintained at https://jsme-editor.github.io/. I made this very simple tutorial on how this editor works in the following video. In the tutorial, I mentioned that a molecule drawn can be exported as a univocal code. There are several accepted codes. One of which is the SMILES code, standing for Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System. In the following exercises, you are asked to draw molecules in the editor, and I give the answers in SMILES code, so that you may check your answer. Exercise 3.1 Draw some basic alkanes, alkenes, and aromatic molecules In the JSME editor below, draw the molecules listed underneath. You can get the SMILES code by either clicking on the smiley icon, or, by clicking on the box with the blue triangles facing each other. You can then compare your answers to the ones below. The version of JSME you can see is from the minimal JSME page. If you do not have access to the page on your browser, you may try to go directly to this JSME page. Another very interesting page is a linkage between wikipedia and JSME available at www.cheminfo.org/wikipedia/ that gives information details about the chemical drawn in the JSME.

There are essentially two types of functional groups, the ones existing on elementary alkane skeleton hydrocarbon resulting from the oxidation of one or several carbons of the alkane original molecule, and the ones resulting from the binding of elementary functionalized hydrocarbon chains. The following paragraphs present the important functional groups on elementary hydrocarbons. 3.2 Functional groups from alkane chain oxidation The first set of principal functional groups relevant to biochemistry are summarized in Figure 3.11. The functional groups can be classified depending on the number of electrons that the carbon on the original alkane molecule (or more precisely the alkyl radical) may have lost to oxidation: 2, 4, or 6 (Figure 3.11). Figure 3.11: Functional groups resulting from the differential oxidation (loss of 2, 4, and 6 electrons to O, S, and N) of an original alkyl carbon atom. Notice that the number of electrons stored on the carbon atom are illustrated in dark blue Losing two electrons to either oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen, generates alcohol (-CH2OH), thiol (-CH2SH), and alkyl amine (-CH2NH2) functional groups, respectively. When O, S, and N only ‘steal’ two electrons from the alkyl carbon, they are in the form of hydroxyl (-OH), sulfanyl (-SH), or amine (-NH2), all of which are also considered as functional groups. Only oxygen can steal four electrons from carbon at once, to form aldehyde (-CHO when the carbon is an end carbon) or ketone (-CO- when the carbon is not an end carbon) functional groups. Within aldehydes and ketone, one can isolate the group C=O, which is then referred to as the carbonyl functional group, and the -C=O, which is then referred to as an acyl functional group (Figure 3.11). An aldehyde is thus an acyl group bonded to a hydrogen. An aldehyde is also a carbonyl group bonded to an alkyl radical (the open ended bond to the left) and a hydrogen. The carbonyl, acyl, hydroxyl, sulfanyl groups are thus identified to ease the description of organic molecules, and even of functional groups (further details later). Losing six electrons automatically implies that the alkyl carbon has lost four to oxygen to form a carbonyl group, and, has then lost two additional carbons, either to oxygen to form a carboxyl or carboxylic acid group, or to nitrogen to form an amide group (Figure 3.11). 3.2.1 Hydroxyl and sulfanyl functional groups We have now used the word radical several times. Technically in chemistry, a radical is an atom, molecule, or ion that has an unpaired valence electron. The radical hydroxyl is and misses one valence electron. The hydroxy (without the ‘l’) functional group is -OH, implying that the hydroxyl radical is bonded to another atom. Hydroxy groups are very common in biochemistry of life. In reality, although the difference between hydroxyl and hydroxy group seems to be the proper nomenclature agreed upon by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry - IUPAC, most chemistry books often used the expression ‘hydroxyl group’ and use the suffix ‘-yl’ for functional groups. Hydroxy groups are most often involved in alcohol and carboxylic acid functional groups. The sulfanyl group -SH is the analog of the hydroxyl group. Oxygen and sulfur are on the same column in the periodic table (Figure 2.1) and have 6 valence electrons. Sulfur is less electronegative and does not readily ‘steal’ electrons as oxygen does. The sulfanyl functional group is involved in the thiol functional group. 3.2.2 Methyl, Methylene, and Ethyl functional groups Methyl (-CH3), Methylene (-CH2- or CH2&lt;), and ethyl (-C2-CH3) functional groups are very common in organic chemistry as they are encountered and form many hydrocarbon chains. Their introduction here is particularly helpful to identify their corresponding moieties, i.e., an identifiable part of a larger molecule, in hydrocarbon chains. Figure 3.12: Five common notations for the methyl functional group Note the five possible notation of the Methyl group, including -Me (Figure 3.12). Methyl group is essentially a methylene (Figure 3.13) group placed at the end of a chain, and as a result has three H atoms. The ethyl group (Figure 3.13) can be seen as a methyl group bonded to a methylene group. But why then, a need for the naming of ethyl? Ethyl groups tend to be rather common in organic molecules, and it makes the identification of this moeity easier this way. Notice the notation -Et. Figure 3.13: Methylene and three common notations for the ethyl functional groups Etymology Corner French chemists Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugène Péligot, after determining methanol’s chemical structure, introduced “methylène” from the Ancient Greek μέθυ (méthu, “wine”) + ὕλη (húlē, “wood, material” with the intention of highlighting its origins, “wine or spirit of wood (vin ou liqueur spiritueuse du bois)” (Dumas and Péligot 1835). The term “methyl” was derived in about 1840 by back-formation from “methylene”, and was then applied to describe “methyl alcohol” (which since 1892 is called “methanol”) (after Wikipedia contributors 2022b) 3.2.3 Phosphoryl functional group The phosphoryl \\(-PO_3^{2-}\\) group or more often referred to as radical, is essential in life as it participate to the phosphorylation of ADP and is the central part of the recycling of the ingredients for cellular energy. Figure 3.14: phosphoryl functional groups 3.2.4 Amine functional group In organic chemistry, amines are compounds and functional groups that contain a basic nitrogen atom with a lone pair. Amines are formally derivatives of ammonia, wherein one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced by a substituent such as an alkyl or aryl group (Wikipedia contributors 2019d). Amines, very much like alcohols, are classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, depending on the number of alkyl groups bonded to the nitrogen atom. The substituent -NH2 is called an amino group, hence the name amino-acids described in the next chapter (Figure 3.15). The nitrogen of amines always has 8 electrons for itself in organic molecules. For primary producers, amines are formed and incorporated into organic molecules directly from the uptake of ammonium, or, after the reduction of nitrate uptaken. Notice the tetrahedral shape of ammonia and amines. Amine groups are bonded to carbon atoms to form alkyl amine groups described below and for which a naming convention exists. Figure 3.15: Ammonia and conjugate acid ammonium, and identified primary, secondary, and tertiary amines Etymology Corner The suffix of amine comes from the French suffix -ine, used to form words for derived substances. Amines are thus derived substances of ammonia or ammonium. Both words in English come from the sal ammoniac which is a rare natural salt made of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). In history, this salt was exported from the hammoniacum region of the Roman province of Cyrenaica in present-day Libya. The Roman name hammoniacum actually comes from the Greek word Ammon. The Greeks have given this name to the Siwa oasis, known for its salt exports, in the middle of the vast sea of sand of the Lybian desert. The word Ammon is a contraction of the Greek word Ammos which means sand, and the name of the god from the nomadic tribes worshiped at Siwa, the Ram God Amon, identified at one point with the Egyptian god Amun Ra, and eventually revered as the king of gods. The mix of the part-Greek, part-Egyptian, and part-Libyan Ram god with the Greek Zeus, lead to Zeus-Ammon or Jupiter Ammon, god with a human head with the horns of a ram. The oracle of the god Ammon was located in the Siwa oasis. The sal ammoniac was particularly used for worshiping at that temple. The Greek word Ammon seems to be a voluntary play on words with Ammos, which means sand. So Ammon was the Zeus of the sand. And this is why there are two ‘m’ to the words ammonia and ammonium. Why, then, do the words amine or amide only have one m…? It is because in French, syllables fall in the middle of repeated consonants like in am·mo·nium. Suffixes -ine or -ide have been added the first syllable of am·mo·nium. It is unclear why the ‘c’ of ammoniac was dropped in English. The ‘c’ reappears in the expression Total Ammoniacal Nitrogen or TAN, which is used in some analytical laboratories and corresponds to the summation of ammonia and ammonium forms in solution. 3.2.5 Carbonyl and acyl functional groups Very much like for hydroxyl and sulfanyl, the carbonyl and acyl groups have been given a name to ease the description of molecules or other functional groups, and are often part of larger functional groups. As described above and illustrated in Figure 3.11, the carbonyl is a carbon double bonded to an oxygen (C=O). The acyl group (-C=O) is a moiety, i.e., part of a molecule, of other functional groups such as aldehyde (-CHO) or carboxylic acids. Acyl groups can have long aliphatic chains on the left of -C=O, particularly when it corresponds to fatty acid residues in lipid molecules (details in section 4.5.3). 3.2.6 Alcohol functional group In chemistry, an alcohol is any organic compound in which the hydroxy functional group (–OH) is bound to a carbon. Most of alcohol groups in organic chemistry are secondary alcohols, which means that the alcohol functional groups -CHOH- are usually embedded in longer carbon chains. Chemists make differences between the number of hydrogens that are bonded to the -COH radical (Figure 3.16). As presented in Figure 3.11, the carbon of alcohol functional groups still have 4 electrons for themselves, which corresponds to the number of valence electrons on C at the natural state. The glucose molecule, out of 6 carbon atoms, has 5 alcohol functional groups! On the nomenclature side, the condensed formula for the primary structure is -CH2OH, and for the secondary structure is -CHOH-. In the condensed formula, the hydroxyl radical OH is purposely separated from the rest to point out that this is an alcohol functional group (Table 3.2). Figure 3.16: Generic alcohol functional group and the identified primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols The naming convention is to use the alkane prefix with the suffix -ol at the end (Table 3.2). An alcohol of propane would be called propanol. A propane with two or three alcohol functional groups would be called propan-di-ol or propan-tri-ol, respectively. Butan-1-ol in Table 3.2 suggests that the alcohol group is on the first carbon atom, and corresponds to a primary alcohol (Figure 3.16). A butan-2-ol, would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the alkyl chain, would correspond to a secondary alcohol (Figure 3.16), and would have CH3-CH2-CHOH-CH3 as a condensed formula. Table 3.2: Naming convention for Alcohols and Thiols with condensed formula and skeletal structures for the first five corresponding alkyl radicals Nb of C atoms Alcohol name and formula Alcohol skeletal structure Thiol name and formula Thiol skeletal structure 1 Methanol CH3OH Methanethiol CH3SH 2 Ethanol CH2-CH2OH Ethanethiol CH2-CH2SH 3 Propan-1-ol CH3-CH2-CH2OH Propanethiol CH3-CH2-CH2SH 4 Butan-1-ol CH3-(CH2)2-CH2OH Butanethiol CH3-(CH2)2-CH2SH 5 Pentan-1-ol CH3-(CH2)3-CH2OH Pentanethiol CH3-(CH2)3-CH2SH Etymology Corner The etymology of alcohol seems to be rather obscure. It certainly comes from the Arabic kohl (كحل), ‘al’ standing for the article of kohl. Kohl refers to as an eyewash lotion, and a very fine and very pure powder used as eye shadow for a long time, possibly by the Egyptians and reported as early as 1278 in Spain. The migration of the meaning of the word from the ‘very fine and very pure powder’ to the ‘spirit of wine’ obtained by ‘very fine and very pure’ reiterated distillation is unclear. The Swiss chemist Paracelsus is generally given as the author in the XVIth century of the migration of the meaning of the word towards the ‘spirit of wine’, or ethanol and as we understand it today. 3.2.7 Thiol functional group Thiols are the sulfur analogue of alcohols (that is, sulfur takes the place of oxygen in the hydroxyl group of an alcohol), and the word is [the combination] of “thio-” + “alcohol”, with the first word deriving from Greek θεῖον (theion) meaning “sulfur” (Wikipedia contributors 2019g). Figure 3.17: Thiol group (left) is the analogue of the hydroxyl group of an alcohol (right) As the functional group of the amino acid cysteine, the thiol group plays a very important role in biology. When the thiol groups of two cysteine residues (as in monomers or constituent units) are brought near each other in the course of protein folding, an oxidation reaction can generate a cysteine unit with a disulfide bond (−S−S−). Disulfide bonds can contribute to a protein’s tertiary structure if the cysteines are part of the same peptide chain, or contribute to the quaternary structure of multi-unit proteins by forming fairly strong covalent bonds between different peptide chains (Wikipedia contributors 2019g). This is presented in more details in the dedicated chapter on proteins The naming convention is to use the alkane name with the suffix -thiol at the end. A thiol of propane would be called propanethiol. 3.2.8 Alkyl amines Alkyl amines are another analogue of alcohols in the sense that an amine functional group replaces a hydroxyl group. The most important molecules where amines exist in biochemistry are amino acids as previously stated. The naming convention is to use the alkane prefix with the suffix -amine at the end (Table 3.3). An amine of propane would be called propanamine. Actually, this naming refers to the fact that an amine has been added to a propane. Another naming is that a propyl radical (CH3-CH2-CH2-) has been added to an amine. In that case, it would be called a propyl-amine. The first naming is alkyl centric, and the other is functional group centric. In the end, both naming are correct and accepted. Butan-1-amine in Table 3.3 suggests that the amine group is on the first carbon atom, and corresponds to a primary amine (Figure 3.15). A butan-2-amine, would have the amine on the second carbon of the alkyl chain, would correspond to a secondary amine (Figure 3.15), and would have CH3-CH2-CHNH2-CH3 as a condensed formula. Table 3.3: Naming convention for Amines and Amides with condensed formula and skeletal structures for the first five corresponding alkyl radicals Nb of C atoms Amine name and formula Amine skeletal structure Amide name and formula Amide skeletal structure 1 Methanamine CH3NH2~ Methanamide HCONH2 2 Ethanamine CH2-CH2NH2 Ethanamide CH2-CONH2 3 Propan-1-amine CH3-CH2-CH2NH2 propylamine Propanamide CH3-CH2-CONH2 4 Butan-1-amine CH3-(CH2)2-CH2NH2 Butanamide CH3-(CH2)2-CONH2 5 Pentan-1-amine CH3-(CH2)3-CH2NH2 Pentanamide CH3-(CH2)3-CONH2 For the anecdote, there are polyamine molecules, two of which are diamines called putrescine (butane-1,4-diamine) and cadaverine (pentane-1,5-diamine). They respectively have a butane and a pentane skeleton with an amine group on the two end carbons. And you guessed it, they have to do with cadavers. They are foul-smelling diamine compound produced by the putrefaction of animal tissue. 3.2.9 Aldehyde functional group Aldehyde functional group consists in a carbonyl group with the carbon atom also bonded to hydrogen. This implies that aldehyde groups are necessarily at the end of an hydrocarbon chain. To differentiate between alcohol and aldehyde groups, the condensed formula for an aldehyde is -CHO. The carbon of an aldehyde functional group has lost 4 electrons to oxygen, and only has 3 for itself (Figure 3.18). Because of the electronegativity of the carbonyl group, aldehyde group are rather polarized, which makes them rather soluble in polar solvent such as water. The general naming convention is to replace the -e of the alkane name with the suffix -al at the end. An aldehyde of propane would be called propanal (Table 3.4). Many fragrances (odors, aroma) are aldehyde molecules. The word aldehyde was coined by Justus von Liebig as a contraction of the Latin alcohol dehydrogenatus (dehydrogenated alcohol). Figure 3.18: Generic aldehyde functional group with the allocation of the electrons to oxygen and carbon atoms 3.2.10 Ketone functional group Ketone functional group consists in a carbonyl group included in the middle of a hydrocarbon chain. The condensed formula for a ketone is -CO-, or sometimes written as -(C=O)-. The carbon of a ketone functional group has lost 4 electrons to oxygen, and only has 2 for itself (Figure 3.19). Figure 3.19: Generic ketone functional group with the allocation of the electrons to oxygen and carbon atoms The general naming convention is to replace the -e of the alkane name with the suffix -one at the end. A ketone of propane would be called propanone (Table 3.4), and in fact is also called acetone for the reasons explained in the etymology corner summary below. Table 3.4: Naming convention for Aldehydes and Ketones with condensed formula and skeletal structures for the first five corresponding alkyl radicals, when applicable Nb of C atoms Aldehyde name and formula Aldehyde skeletal structure Ketone name and formula Ketone skeletal structure 1 Methanal CH2Oformaldehyde 2 Ethanal CH2-CHO 3 Propanal CH3-CH2-CHO Propanone CH3-CO-CH3 acetone 4 Butanal CH3-(CH2)2-CHO Butanone CH3-CH2-CO-CH3 5 Pentanal CH3-(CH2)3-CHO Pentan-2-one CH3-(CH2)2-CO-CH3 Etymology Corner The English word ketone comes from the German Aketon, itself derived from the French acétone. The French chemist Antoine Bussy proposed to add the suffix -one to products of some his distillation experiments. One of which was obtained by the dry distillation of acetic acid (ethanoic acid), which he then named acétone (Bussy 1833). This can be somewhat confusing because acetic acid is a C2 and acétone is a C3 hydrocarbon… But science is rooted in history! 3.2.11 Carboxyl functional group The carboxyl group (properly called carboxy group by the IUPAC, but every text book uses interchangeably carboxyl radical and carboxyl group), is an aldehyde group that would have lost two additional electrons to oxygen via an hydroxyl group (Figure 3.20). The condensed formula for a carboxyl group is -COOH. The carboxyl group is always at the end of a hydrocarbon chain, in which case the group is referred to as a carboxylic acid. Yes, you read correctly, with the carboxyl group, we are entering the world of acid and base (sensu Brønsted), pH, etc. But why so? Figure 3.20: Generic carboxyl functional group with the allocation of the electrons to oxygen and carbon atoms (top reaction), and delocalization of electrons on carboxylate giving carboxylates relative stability for 6 &lt; pH &lt; 8 Looking at the top row of Figure 3.20, it is obvious that there is plethora of electrons for the carboxyl group, all captured by the two oxygen atoms. However, the level of energy to maintain contiguous double bond of the carbonyl and the single bond of the hydroxyl groups is higher than when the hydroxyl group loses a proton H+, leaving the oxygen of the hydroxyl group to be negative. Without the hydrogen, the extra electron can, with the π electrons of the double bond of the carbonyl group, be delocalized (bottom row of Figure 3.20). This is not too distant from the aromatic molecules, in that the -COO- end is rather stable. This explains why the carboxyl group behaves as an acid as it can readily release an H+ in solution. The stability of the carboxylic acid form (-COOH) versus its conjugate base form (carboxylate -COO-) depends on the pH of the solution and is discussed in the dedicated acid-base chapter. Because of the density of electrons near the oxygen atoms, the functional group is very polar, even in its acid form, and rather hydrophylic. The general naming convention for the carboxyl group is two fold. For the acidic form (-COOH), it is to replace the -e of the alkane name with the suffix -oic acid at the end. A carboxylic acid of propane would be called propanoic acid. For the anionic form (-COO-), the naming convention is to replace the -e of the alkane name with the suffix -oate at the end. The anion form of a carboxylic acid of propane would be called propanoate. Table 3.5: Naming convention for Carboxylic acids and Carboxylates with condensed formula and skeletal structures for the first five corresponding alkyl radicals Nb of C atoms Carboxylic Acid name and formula Carboxylic Acid skeletal structure Carboxylate name and formula Carboxylate skeletal structure 1 Methanoic acid CHOOHformic acid Methanoate CHOO-formate 2 Ethanoic acid CH2-COOHacetic acid Ethanoate CH2-COO-acetate 3 Propanoic acid CH3-CH2-COOH Propanoate CH3-CH2-COO- 4 Butanoic acid CH3-(CH2)2-COOH Butanoate CH3-(CH2)2-COO- 5 Pentanoic acid CH3-(CH2)3-COOH Pentanoate CH3-(CH2)3-COO- 3.2.12 Amide functional group The amide functional group can be seen as a derivative of carboxylic acid where the hydroxyl group is replaced by the amine functional group. In that case, it can be seen as an oxidation of a single carbon of an alkyl radical. In reality, for most amide groups, at least one of the hydrogen of the amine group is replaced by another hydrocarbon chain, as illustrated in Figure 3.21 below. In that case, amides can be seen as assemblages of functionalized molecules described in the next section. Figure 3.21: Generic amide functional groups, with the allocation of the electrons to oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon atoms. Because oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen, and because of the double π bond of the carbonyl (C=O) group, the lone pair available on the nitrogen tends to be delocalized into the carbonyl group, forming a partial double bond between nitrogen and the carbonyl group (Figure 3.22). Figure 3.22: Generic amide functional groups, with the allocation of the electrons to oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon atoms. This forms an electron resonance system that is rather stable. In fact, experience shows that the amide functional group is planar without free rotation about the C-N bond, which fits well with the resonance structure and the partial double bond between C and N (Figure 3.23). Figure 3.23: Amide functional group, with the R groups as methyls. The colors follow for C, H, O, N, respectively grey, white, red, and blue. Notice that the amide group is planar This property actually has some fantastic consequences in the chemistry of life. The amide functional group corresponds to the peptidic bond existing between consecutive amino acids in a protein (details in section 4.3 dedicated to proteins). In other words, because of the resonance structure and the partial double bond of the amide functional group, hence its strong and planar structure, proteins can take a specific and rigid structure in three dimensions. The amide functional group is present in sphingolipids and make these molecules a lot more rigid than the other membrane lipids, and thus play a role in the insertion of proteins in lipid rafts of membranes (details in section 4.5.6). The naming convention is to use the alkane prefix with the suffix -amide at the end (Table 3.3). An amide of propane would be called propanamide. The generally accepted condensed formula for amides is -CONH2, making butanamide have CH3-(CH2)2-CONH2 as a condensed formula (Table 3.3). 3.2.13 Methoxy functional group The methoxy functional group (-OCH3) is not nearly as well known as the ones presented above. However, the methoxy functional group is very common among phenolics, which are a group of secondary metabolites introduced in chapter 4. Because of lignins, phenolics are the second most represented molecules in mass, after cellulose! Many phenolics are the molecules for aromas, colors, natural pesticides, or structure (e.g., lignins). The methoxy group bonded to an aromatic ring can be seen as an ether bond between the aromatic ring and a methyl group (Figure 3.24). Figure 3.24: Three common notations for the methoxy functional group (in blue). methoxy groups are generally found on aromatic groups where they generally serve as Electron Donating Groups. The molecule represented is guaiacol, one of the phenolics molecules that bring the earthly smell of soil The methoxy group, along with the hydroxyl group, is a very common substituent on the aromatic ring of phenolics molecules, probably because it acts as an Electron Donating Group (the curious among you can read the details in the glossary) to the aromatic ring, balancing the tendency of other groups to withdraw electrons from the aromatic ring. This paragraph completes the list of principal functional groups of major importance for biochemistry. This list is not exhaustive but sufficient for the goals of this book. Exercise 3.2 Train your knowledge on the simple functional groups ! Do it yourself!

Figure 3.25 below summarizes the principal complex functional groups resulting from the binding of two simple functional groups. It becomes very apparent that the alcohol and carboxyl functional groups play, with phosphate, a preponder role in the formation of complex functional groups, and in the binding of simple molecules together to form more complex ones. Each of the groups are presented in more details below. Figure 3.25: Complex functional groups resulting from the combination of simple functional groups illustrating the preponderant role of alcohol, carboxylic acid and phosphate 3.3.1 Ester functional group Esters are common in organic chemistry and biological materials, and often have a pleasant characteristic, fruity odor. Ester functional groups are formed from the condensation reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol group (Figure 3.26). Because of the electronegativity of the oxygen and the double π bond of the carbonyl, the hydroxyl group in the carboxyl group reacts with the hydrogen of the alcohol group to form the ester bond. The ester bond is essential in biochemistry particularly for lipids. Figure 3.26: Esterification: condensation reaction between a carboxylic acid with an alcohol Esters are named as if the alkyl chain from the alcohol is a substituent. This is followed by the name of the parent chain from the carboxylic acid part of the ester with an –e remove and replaced with the ending –oate. There are more subtil naming conventions from esters, particularly when the carbon bonded to the ester bond in the substituent chain is not an end carbon, but this is unimportant for our goal here. Additional naming nomenclature details can be found here. Figure 3.27: The substituent alkyl chain from the alcohol is a propyl. The parent chain name with a carboxyl group is ethanoic acid, which in the ester bond, becomes ethanoate. In the end the name of the molecule is propylethanoate 3.3.2 Thioesters Following the analogy between alcohol and thiol functional groups, thioesters are the analogue of esters. Thioester functional groups are formed from the condensation reaction between a carboxylic acid and a thiol group (Figure 3.28). Figure 3.28: Thioesterification: condensation reaction between a carboxylic acid with a thiol. Notice the skwiggly blue line illustrating an energy bond. In the thioester functional group, there are a great number of somewhat mobile electrons next to each other, namely through the double oxygen bond, and thanks to the sulfur atom, which has d orbitals. As a result, the C-S bond (C of the carbonyl (C=O)) is reputed to be unstable because of the electronic repulsion, and was often represented with the tilde (~) sign in the past (Lipmann 1941) and misnamed ‘high energy bond’. In reality, it is the hydrolysis of the thioester bond that releases energy, i.e., that is exergonic (more details in section dedicated to ATP). This suggests that another source of energy is needed to make the C-S bond in the first place. This is detailed in this chapter. This property is paramount and explains the central role or the major thioester example in biochemistry, i.e., the famous acetyl-coA. This complicated molecule’s function is to deliver the acetyl group to the Krebs cycle to be oxidized for energy production. The acronym coA stands for coenzyme A, i.e., a non-protein enzyme. 3.3.3 Phosphoesters The second analogue to esters are the phosphoesters. This time, the carboxylic acid is replaced by a phosphoric acid H3PO4. In reality, depending on the pH, the actual form of the acid might be H2PO4-, HPO42-, or PO43- (Figure 2.7), all of which are loosely referred to as ‘phosphates’ (details in section 11 dedicated to acid-base reactions). So phosphates can react with alcohol functional groups to form phosphoester bonds (Figure 3.29). Figure 3.29: Phosphoesterification: condensation reaction between a phosphate with an alcohol The most famous phosphoester bond is actually the phosphodiester bond that binds nucleotides together in the RNA and DNA molecules. Etymology Corner The word ester has been coined by German chemist Leopold Gmelin in the 1820s. For some, this is a “pure invention” from Gmelin; others suggest that it is a contraction from the German Essigäther name for ethyl acetate, from Essig which means vinegar and Äther, which means ether. Ethyl acetate has a fruity pleasant smell. It is likely that Gmelin used the word ester after the famously beautiful Queen Esther from the Book of Esther in the Hebrew Bible. The word ether was first introduced by the German-born chemist Frobenius in 1729 (Frobenius 1729) when describing the properties of diethyl ether and he named this substance “Spiritus Vini Æthereus”. The word Æthereus most likely refers to the volatility of ethers rising to the sky. The Latin word aethēr from Ancient Greek αἰθήρ (aithḗr) refers to the “highest and purest part of the atmosphere, to air, heavens, sky, light of day, but also ethereal matter surrounding a deity” (“Ether - Wiktionary,” n.d.). This corresponds to the time when the ancients did not know about the vacuum of space and named æther the medium supposed to fill unoccupied space above the atmosphere and able to transmit heat and light. 3.3.4 Ether functional group Ether functional group result from the condensation reaction between two alcohol groups (Figure 3.30). Ethers are very volatile compounds. Diethyl ether (CH3-CH2-O-CH2-CH3) is commonly refer to as ether by itself. It is a volatile flammable liquid and has been used as anesthetic for a long time. Its side effects of post-anesthetic nausea and vomiting have made it seldom used in the XXIst century. Figure 3.30: Etherification: condensation reaction between two alcohols Ether functional group is extremely common in carbohydrates, although it is referred to as the glycosidic bond then because there is at least one carbohydrate involved. 3.3.5 Disulfide functional groups Dissulfide function groups are common in proteins are also often referred to as disulfide bridges. 3.3.6 Hemiacetal and hemiketal functional groups A hemiacetal or a hemiketal is a compound that results from the addition of an alcohol to an aldehyde or a ketone, respectively. Hemiacetal and hemiketal groups are extremely important in biology as they are responsible for the cycling of carbohydrate monomers! The prefix hemi- which means half in Greek, suggests that this is only half a reaction. An acetal or ketal would be the full reaction, but this is besides the point because the hemiacetal and hemiketal are the important groups in biochemistry. Figure 3.31: Addition of an alcohol nucleophile to a ketone or aldehyde forms an hemiketal and hemiactal functional group, respectively As illustrated in Figure 3.31, there is an asymetry in these two functional groups, with a hydroxyde group above and an alkyl ether group at the bottom. This asymetry is one of the reasons why these functional groups are not very stable theoretically. However in cyclic molecules like glucose (Figure 3.32) or fructose (Figure 3.33), these functional groups are stable, yet easily reversible. Figure 3.32: Intramolecular cyclic hemiacetal formation in glucose and more generally for pyranose hexoses Figure 3.33: Intramolecular cyclic hemiketal formation in fructose and more generally for furanose hexoses This property is essential and explains why glucose can, when polymerized, form cellulose, a stable fiber, and, be easily transformed into its linear not cyclic form where it can be hydrolized for energy generation! More details in section 4.2.1. 3.3.7 Anhydride and phosphoanhydride functional groups The condensation reaction between two carboxylic acids leads to the formation of the anhydride functional group (Figure 3.34). Honestly, this functional group is not particularly common in biochemistry. Figure 3.34: Condensation reaction between two carboxylic acids results in the formation of an anhydride functional group However, its phosphorus analogue has a major role in the biochemistry of life. The condensation of a phosphate and a carboxylic acid yields a phosphoanhydride bond (see Table 3.6). The condensation of two phosphates yields a diphospho anhydride bond (Figure 3.35). Figure 3.35: Condensation reaction between two phosphates results in the formation of a phosphoanhydride functional group. The resulting two phosphate molecule is called a pyrophosphate. The skwiggly blue line has been added to show that the hydrolysis of the anhydride bond releases energy Similarly to thioesters, and at a higher energy level, the concentration of electrons at the diphospho anhydride bond creates great instability between bonded phosphate tetrahedra (Degens 1989). As a result, the hydrolysis of this bond is exergonic and releases energy. This has been represented in Figure 3.35 above with a skiggly line. Many biochemists have banned the used of this skwiggly line (e.g., Moran 2012) and the concept of ‘high enrgy bond’ introduced by Lipmann in -Lipmann (1941) and represented as a “~”, as it gave the false impression that the bond in itself had a high energy, which it does not. We have decided to use another skwiggly representation to show the instability of this linkage and hence the energy release during hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of one of the diphospho anhydride bond is the fundamental principle for the release of energy from ATP, Adenosine Tri-Phosphate, producing an ADP (Adenosine Di-Phosphate) and a phosphate group. ATP can be formed from the assemblage again of ADP plus a phosphate. The source of energy for reassembling ATP is mechanical at the molecular scale (details in section 5.2 dedicated to ATP and energy).

Guess the name of this very common molecule! 3.4 Summary on functional groups and important radicals The list provided above is not exhaustive, but enough to identify most functional groups in organic molecules associated with the biochemistry of life. The names of these functional groups are used throughout this book and this chapter has been designed to serve as a reference when in doubt. In addition to functional groups, there are several molecules or radicals, which are very common and must be known. They are illustrated in Figure 3.36. The phenyl radical is a benzene ring. The reason for the name is explain in an etymology corner before. Phenol is an hydroxy benzene. Acetic acid is the acid in vinegar and is also named ethanoic acid. The base conjugate is called acetate or ethanoate. Glycerol is a propane-triol and serves as a skeleton to lipids where it forms ester bonds with fatty acids. Glyceraldehyde is a glycerol for which one carbon has been oxidized into an aldehyde. The phosphated version of glyceraldehyde, i.e., glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (3 because the phosphoester bond is on the third carbon of the glyceraldehyde) or more commonly referred to as G3P, is generally considered the prime end-product of photosynthesis. Glucose is then assembled from two G3P. Pyruvate, the base conjugate of pyruvic acid, is the end-product of the glycolysis, i.e., the first step in the oxidation of glucose requiring no exogenous electron acceptor. A list of for acid and acyl radicals commonly found in biochemistry can also be found at this site, and more generally the nomenclature of organic chemistry can be found on the IUPAC nomenclature website. Figure 3.36: Very common molecules and radicals that have special names in addition to the IUPAC ones Finally, the functional groups of importance are summarized in Table 3.6 and an example is given to each one when applicable.

Details of each are summarized in this chapter These four family constitute what we refer to as primary metabolites and are considered ubiquitous to all plants for growth and development Plants metabolize secondary metabolites, most of which are referred to as phenolics for defense against other organisms, as signaling compounds, and for protection against ultraviolet radiation and oxidants Phenolics play a disproportionate role in regulating microbially mediated processes in ecologically engineered treatment systems In organic molecules, about 4 electrons are stored on each carbon atom, none on the phosphorus, and always 8 electrons on the nitrogen and sulfur atoms 4.1 Polymers of simple monomers When scientists of the 18th century observed nature, they thought there had to be major differences between animated organisms and the inanimate ones. In fact they thought that the elements at the basis of the animated vs. inanimate things had to be different. One can only wonder at the incredible diversity and complexity of forms between a bacterium and humans, and between unicellular algae and sequoia trees! And yet, despite the incredible variations of life forms and sizes, there is a common theme: very complex organic molecules correspond to the assemblage of simple molecules and in many cases are polymers of relatively simple monomers. In the image of a brick wall and the skyscraper in Figure 4.1, it is possible to make a small wall or a huge skyscraper. Brick walls are made of bricks and of mortar to hold the bricks together. If one adds metal pieces, wood, etc. the complexity of the final product can be infinite, yet it is made from simple elementary pieces. Figure 4.1: Small and large structures can be built from the addition of bricks, one at a time Living organisms are essentially made of very complex polymers, but which are in most cases built from simple monomers. Just like in a building which complexity results from the assemblage of different types of material, e.g., bricks, wood, metal, etc., living organisms are assembled from distinct ‘types of molecules’. Among the very complex organic polymers, one can distinguish four molecular families. Molecular families can be identified because within a family, there are polymers of similar monomers the monomers are distinct between families and there tends to be unique chemical bonds between consecutive monomers allowing polyremisation. The vast majority of the organic matter that makes cells and organisms have been classified into four molecular families: Carbohydrates Proteins Nucleic acids Lipids The monomers of these four families are sometimes referred to as primary metabolites in the sense that they are ubiquitous in the plant and animal world and constitute the elementary bricks for most of the functions and structures of living creatures from bacteria to humans. This chapter will present in details the monomers and polymers for each of the family. As I was writing this book, it became obvious that I could not ignore another important group of molecules which play a disproportionate role in ecological engineering: the phenolics. Phenolics are referred to as secondary metabolites “not directly essential for basic photosynthetic or respiratory metabolism but are thought to be required for plants’ survival in the environment. […] Secondary metabolites apparently act as defense (against herbivores, microbes, viruses, or competing plants) and signal com-pounds (to attract pollinating or seed dispersing animals), as well as protecting the plant from ultraviolet radiation and oxidants.” (Lattanzio 2013). We will explore the mystery behind these fascinating molecules. Before we get into the details of each family and of phenolics, Table 4.1 below summarizes some of the major attributes of each of the molecular family. Although the CHONSP elements constitute organic matter in general, no one family is constituted of all these six atoms! Carbohydrates and lipids are mostly made of CHO, with additional N and P for lipids. Proteins are the only molecules where S is present. Carbohydrates and lipids play a major role in energy storage and cellular structure, while nucleic acids only store and transcribe the genetic information, and this information is transcribed into very precise sequence of amino acids forming proteins and giving them their functions. Table 4.1: Summary of the key attributes to the four major molecular families Carbohydrates Proteins Nucleic Acids Lipids General formula CnH2nOn CHONS CHONP CHO(N)P Monomers monosaccharides, hexoses amino acids nucleotides fatty acids + backbone + polar head Number of electrons stored ~4 on C ~4 on C, 8 on N and S ~4 on C, 8 on N, 0 on P ~6 on C, 8 on N, 0 on P Cement glycosidic bond peptidic bond phosphodiester bond ester, ether, and phosphoester bond Functions Storage and transport of energy, cell and organism structure reaction catalysis, exchange, regulation, information transfer genetic code storage and transcription cell structure and energy storage Examples sucrose, cellulose, starch, chitin, glycogen enzymes, keratin, muscles, hemoglobin RNAs and DNA fatty acids, oils, cholesterol Understanding and knowing enough of the atomic and molecular makeshift of organic matter in general and of each molecular family in particular, belongs in our opinion, to the minimum ‘alphabet’ needed to better understand biogeochemical processes as organic matter is the fuel for all these processes. 4.2 Carbohydrates Carbohydrates form the entry molecules onto which electrons are first stored in photosynthesis, and precisely on the carbon atoms. The generic formula for carbohydrates is (CH2O)n, and each atom, on average, has 4 electrons for itself as illustrated in Figure 4.2. We have seen in the previous chapter that having 4 electrons stored on each C is probably the most cost effective way to store many electrons on organic molecules. Figure 4.2: Electron allocation of a generic carbohydrate (CH2O)n Carbohydrates are a rather homogeneous group as they include clearly identified monomers and polymers of these monomers. Most monomers are C6 or C5 rings and can, depending on their nature and on their polymerization type, serve very different purposes including energy storage (e.g., starch), structure (e.g., cellulose or chitin of cructacean shells), or as backbone of RNA (e.g., ribose). On an everyday life basis, carbohydrates are present in paper, sugar, pasta, grain, etc. (some common carbohydrates in food illustrated in Figure 4.3). Figure 4.3: Assortment of everyday food containing carbohydrates. Obtained from https://www.measureup.com.au/all-about-carbohydrates/ 4.2.1 Monosaccharides The monomers of carbohydrates are called monosaccharides (from Greek monos, i.e., single, and sacchar, sugar) or called simple sugars or oses (from the Latin “full of, abounding in, having qualities of”). The monomers that are assembled into complex polymers generally are hexoses, that is that they have 6 carbons, and are isomers of glucose. However, monosaccharides do include more than just hexoses or C6H12O6, and it is important to present them in general, and not just the monomers of polysaccharides. Most monosaccharides are made of 3 to 6 carbons (there actually are C7 to C9 oses) and are classified in aldoses or ketoses, depending on whether they have a aldehyde (-CHO) on their C#1 or a ketone (-C=O) radical, usually on the carbon numbered #2 (details on these functional groups in sections 3.2.9 and 3.2.10). They either exist in linear chains and are then represented in Fischer projection like in Figures 4.4 and 4.5, or, for pentoses (C5) and hexoses (C6), exist in cyclic chains (Figures 4.12 and 4.11). Carbohydrates have been given a lot of codes and naming conventions and it is hard to avoid them if we want to put things together. So, there is no reason to fear all the names and letters used to describe and differentiate carbohydrates. The goal is: to realize the large diversity of monosaccharides to realize that the differences between, e.g., the hexoses are of steric consideration, i.e., which side are the hydroxy (-OH) groups of the linear chain, right or left. to realize that C5 and C6 carbohydrates alternate between chain and cyclic molecular configurations. The cyclic form prevails for the functions of transport and structure that the carbohydrates provide. The chain form is the form needed for the release of electrons and energy. Both forms interchange freely for monosaccharides. Figure 4.4: classification of C3 to C6 aldoses in Fischer projection. Triose : (1) D-(+)-glyceraldehyde ; Tetroses : (2a) D-(−)-erythrose ; (2b) D-(−)-threose ; Pentoses : (3a) D-(−)-ribose ; (3b) D-(−)-arabinose ; (3c) D-(+)-xylose ; (3d) D-(−)-lyxose ; Hexoses : (4a) D-(+)-allose ; (4b) D-(+)-altrose ; (4c) D-(+)-glucose ; (4d) D-(+)-mannose ; (4e) D-(−)-gulose ; (4f) D-(−)-idose ; (4g) D-(+)-galactose ; (4h) D-(+)-talose. after Yikrazuul — personal work, public Domain Time to incorporate some jargon. When in the chain form necessary for the carbons to donate their electrons, monosaccharides are called reducing sugars. This means that they are able to donate their electrons, to drive respiration and the generation of energy in the cell (details in Chapter 5). So, despite the fact that each carbon atom on monosaccharides has on average 4 electrons to give, potentially, this does not systematically happen. This is rather unexpected. Indeed, for the pentoses and hexoses to be reducing sugars, they must be in the aldose form, or have a free aldehyde at the end of their chain or on carbon #1. Does this rules out the ketoses? Actually no, the ketoses in the chain form can be readily tautomerized into aldoses. This is only important to explain some of the differences in disaccharides. Figure 4.5: classification of C3 to C6 ketoses in Fischer projection. Triose : (1) dihydroxyacetone ; Tetrose : (2) D-erythrulose ; Pentoses : (3a) D-ribulose ; (3b) D-xylulose ; Hexoses : (4a) D-psicose ; (4b) D-fructose ; (4c) D-sorbose ; (4d) D-tagatose. after Yikrazuul — personal work, public Domain You might wonder what the D-(+) or D-(-) might mean in the legends of Figures 4.4 and 4.5… This is due to optical rotation properties that a pure solution of a particular ose has because of the asymmetry of the molecules. The different forms of hexoses in, e.g., Figure 4.4 are called eniantiomers. D means that the hydroxy group on the C#n-1 to the right of the molecule and most natural oses tend to be D (few oses have it on the left, in which case they are coded as L). The (+) or (-) tell whether the light rotation is pulled towards positive or negative angles. OK, lots of terms here, mostly to quench some of the curiosity of the biochemist in you. The first lesson from this litany of hexoses calls for a bit of putting things together. Carbohydrates in general are the entry point for life to store high energy electrons onto carbon, via photosynthesis. All hexoses presented above, and in fact all monosaccharides, have on average 4 electrons stored on the carbon atoms. This is the most efficient way to store electrons because it consists in storing the number equivalent of the number of valence electrons on carbon in its natural state, that is 4 electrons. So carbohydrates do have, on average, 4 electrons per carbon atom. It turns out that alcohol functional groups allow the storage of 4 electons per carbon atom in a carbon chain. Carbohydrates must thus have chains of alcohol groups. However, because carbohydrates are the entry point to store energy, the elementary molecules synthesized have to be relatively small not to add weight onto leaves where they are produced and such that they can be easily transported away from the leaves into storage areas. The elementary molecules in carbohydrates are C3, C5 and C6 molecules, which fulfills the need for small molecules. Figure 4.6: Natural formation of aldoses and ketoses from a hypothetical hexan-hex-ol to keep 4 electrons per atom on average for a C6 carbohydrate. The electrons have been allocated on the carbon atoms (green line) according to the electronegativity rule. The electrons on the oxygen atoms have been ignored because they do not participate in the storage of electrons The result of this demonstration is that on a C6 hexose molecule, there should be 24 electrons stored. Using a chain of 6 alcohol groups yields a hexan-hex-ol, where the end carbons have 5 electrons for themselves, hence a total of 26 electrons, or 2 more than expected (Figure 4.6). The ‘solution’ nature has found is to replace one of the end alcohol groups with either an aldehyde group at the end, or another alcohol group with a ketone group. The first case leads to aldoses and the second to ketoses described above. It it thus no accident that monosaccharides have aldehyde and ketone functional groups. For the anecdote, hexan-hex-ol isomers represented on the left of Figure 4.6 do exist in nature in small amounts and are now synthesized in the industry as thickeners and low calories sweeteners because they are poorly absorbed by the intestines. They are referred to as sugar alcohols as the suffix -itol indicates. Some names might be familiar and include xylitol, sorbitol, and mannitol. Putting C6 hex-ols into a cycle leads to inositol or cyclohexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol, which is an essential compound in the brain. All of the sugar alcohols are synthesized from glucose by plants and animals. Actually, in inositol, each carbon does have 4 electrons for itself, so nature could have kept it to store energy. However, the C-C covalent bonds are difficult to break, and nature has not kept this option. Rather, it went for glucose, the solution that could quickly store and release energy, and provide structural strength. And all that in one molecule! Now that we have a more holistic view of what monosaccharides are made of, for all our purposes, we will reduce all this great variability to a few of them, which are glyceraldehyde (C3), ribose and deoxyribose (C5), and, glucose and fructose (C6). Glyceraldehyde is an important intermediate molecule of photosynthesis and is an example of the demonstration above for a C3 carbohydrate (Figure 4.7). We have seen the glycerol molecule in section 3.4, which is a propan-tri-ol, or three hydroxy group on each of the 3 carbons, which ends up as a moiety for lipids. Glyceraldehyde apparently looks like a glycerol of which an end alcohol group would be oxidized to an aldehyde group. This is technically true but it is better to view the aldehyde group as a necessity to keep 4 electrons per carbon atom. Figure 4.7: Fisher projection (left) and skeletal formula (right) of D-glyceraldehyde Hexose and pentose monosaccharides have two main roles: an energy release role when they are in their linear form, and a structural role when they are in their cyclic configuration as they serve as structural moeities (pentoses) and as the elementary monomers for the construction of disaccharides or more complex carbohydrates (hexoses). This might, admitedly, sound a little odd, as one might have the idea that a molecule is a rather stable physical entity. In their linear form, they can be incorporated into the metabolic pathway of cells where the electrons stored on the carbons can be released. A ‘sugar’ (i.e., the generic term also used to describe carbohydrates) that has the ability to act as a reducing agent because it has a free aldehyde group or a free ketone group, is referred to as a reducing sugar. Thanks to their ability to freely switch from a linear to a cycling form, C5 and C6 monosaccharides are reducing sugars. Pentoses and hexoses have the tendency to form cyclic or ring molecules “through a nucleophilic addition reaction between the carbonyl group and one of the hydroxys of the same molecule. The reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging oxygen atom” (Wikipedia contributors 2018e). This property, again, is the result of the necessity to have either an aldehyde or a ketone group in the C6 chain to keep the average of 4 electrons per carbon atom. The most common rings are made of 5 or 6 atoms, respectively, with four C atoms and one O atom, and, five C atoms and one O atom (cyclic forms also referred to as furanose - Figure 4.8 - and pyranose - Figure 4.9 - , respectively, because they closely resemble furan, and pyran rings). Figure 4.8: Intramolecular cyclic hemiketal formation in fructose and more generally for furanose hexoses Figure 4.9: Intramolecular cyclic hemiacetal formation in glucose and more generally for pyranose hexoses Now, as the pentoses and hexoses form rings, the acetal functional group is formed (as previously detailed in section 3.3.6). For the aldohexoses to form rings, the aldehyde on carbon #1 (Figures 4.9) reacts with the hydroxy of carbon #5 to form a 6 atom ring. And in can easily revert to the chain structure to have a free aldehyde again and be a reducing sugar. For fructose, a ketohexose, the ketone from carbon #2, reacts with the hydroxy of also carbon #5, to now form a 5 atom ring (Figure 4.8). So why is this important enough to be mentioned here…? Figure 4.10: Structure of a generic acetal By NEUROtiker - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3508032 In the ring versions of the glucose and fructose, the carbons #1 and #2 now have single bonds with two oxygen atoms. This acetal group formed by a central carbon, and bonded in a tetrahedral as illustrated in Figure 4.10 is a rather special bond. In fact, special enough that it has some interesting consequences, with two different forms. If one of the atoms bonded to oxygen is different than hydrogen (e.g., R’ and R” in Figure 4.10 both not H), then this group is called an acetal group, and the bond is a rather stable bond. If one of the R’ or R” in Figure 4.10 is H, while the other has some other radical, then the structure becomes asymmetric, the group formed is then called hemiacetal as is not nearly as stable. This explains why the hexoses may so easily switch from the linear chain to the cyclic configurations. These hemiacetal and hemiketal groups are one of the basis of the glycosidic bond, which binds the cyclic pentoses and hexoses in di- and polysaccharides, but also with other molecules. Figure 4.11: Cyclic structure or Haworth projection of alpha-D-glucopyranose (alpha-D-glucose; left) and beta-D-fructofuranose (beta-D-fructose; right) In Figure 4.11, both glucose and fructose are hexoses. But fructose generally forms furanose rings (5 atoms, including one oxygen atom), while glucose forms pyranose rings. The α and β correspond to whether the hydroxy on the C#1 atom is below (α) or above (β) the plan made by the ring. Some more jargon here added for exactness of information only. Figure 4.12: Cyclic structure of beta-D-Ribofuranose (beta-D-ribose) and 2-deoxyribose Ribose and deoxyribose are the most important pentoses we need to know as they constitute one of the three ensembles or moeities that constitute nucleotides, i.e., the monomers of nucleic acids. They both exist either in furanose or pyranose forms, although the furanose form dominates, but the difference between ribose and deoxyribose is the missing oxygen atom on the 2’ carbon atom (Figure 4.12). And indeed, this difference is the reason for the ‘R’ and ‘D’ in the RNA and DNA molecules. Notice that the carbon atoms are numbered in Figures 4.11 and 4.12. The numbers are ‘primed’ for the ribose and deoxyribose (Figure 4.12). This is a convention that geneticists have used to differentiate the carbons from the pentose to those of the base in nucleotides (see part on nucleic acids). This is anecdotal information again.

One of the ways is the Haworth projection as shown in Figures 4.11 and 4.12. Another way is called the Fischer projection as illustrated in Figures 4.4 and 4.5. Another way is called the skeletal formula where the carbons are implied at the corners and the ends of line segments, while oxygen and other remarkable radicals such as hydroxy or amine are noted. Glucose is thus often represented as skeletal formula as in the left of Figure 4.13. Another even more simplified representation of glucose is represented in the ‘hyper’ skeletal formula. The latter has the advantage to be simple enough and used to illustrate polysaccharides. Figure 4.13: Skeletal formula for alpha-D-glucose (left), ‘hyper’ skeletal formula (center), and 3-D representation with C in grey, O in red, and H in white. Notice that in 3-D, the pyranose ring is not flat. It would if it were an aromatic ring In reality, there is an entire field of chemical research that deals with the representation of molecules, often in 3D, using computer graphics. A scalable 3-D representation of alpha-D glucose can be directly visualized at this location for example. 4.2.2 Dissacharides Sucrose, lactose, and maltose are three common dissaccharides. Dissacharides are bioses or polymers of two hexose monomers. Because they are still small, and thanks to their solubility in water (thanks to hydroxy groups), they play an essential role to transport energy in chemical forms because for a slight increase of the osmotic pressure in a liquid, dissaccharides carry twice the number of electrons. Dissaccharides correspond to the assemblage of two monosaccharides thanks to the glycosidic bond. The name of this bond suggests that it is very specific to carbohydrates, and it is true as one monosaccharide must be involved in a glycosidic bond. So the glycosidic bond is a type of covalent bond that joins a carbohydrate (sugar) molecule to another group, which may or may not be another carbohydrate. The common theme, however, is that the carbon of the sugar involved corresponds to that of the hemiacetal group. There are 4 types of glycosidic bonds, depending on the atom directly linked to the hemiacetal carbon of the carbohydrate: O-, N-, S-, or C-glycosidic bonds. Figure 4.14 illustrates the generic O- and N-glycosidic bond. Figure 4.14: Formation of glycosidic bonds between a hemiacetal Carbon and a hydroxy or amine group, to respectively form O- and N-glycosidic bonds. The N-glycosidic bond occurs in nucleotides and thus plays a major role. But overall, the term glycosidic bond generally refers to the O-glycosidic bond between two consecutive monosaccharides (Figure 4.15). In the end, and to go back to the brick and mortar analogy, for di- and polysaccharides, the glycosidic bond is the equivalent of the mortar. Figure 4.15: Formation of glycosidic bonds between a glucose hemiacetal carbon and a methyl hydroxyde (top) or between two glucoses to form maltose Lactose and maltose (Figure 4.16) are dissaccharides, respectively assembled from a galactose and a glucose, and, from two glucose molecules. Notice that these two molecules are reducing sugars, i.e., there is one hemicetal carbon (C#1) free to potentially open one glucose into a chain form, hence the ability for both lactose and maltose to be readily available as electron donors. This is quite nice for lactose produced by mammal females to be readily available for their offsprings. On another note, during seed germination, starch (details below) is hydrolyzed into maltose first by the amylase enzyme, and then readily participate in energy generation for this critical time of seed plant lives. Figure 4.16: Lactose and maltose dissaccharides molecular formulae Interestingly, sucrose in not a reducing sugar as both hemiacetal carbons (C#1 of glucose, and C#2 of fructose) are part of the glycosidic bond (Figure 4.17). There are several advantages: Figure 4.17: Sucrose molecular formula Sucrose is a very stable molecule, and a lot more than lactose and maltose. Hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond is very slow and solutions of sucrose can last for a very long time. Because both hemiacetal carbons are bonded, there are no more possibilities for an additional glycosidic bond to take place: sucrose stays as a dissaccharide This is actually essential for green vascular plants, which assemble sucrose in their leaves from glucose and fructose, but must transport these molecules away from the leaves to minimize weight and avoid jamming of the photosynthesis. So having a very stable, highly soluble, not polymerisable, non reducing molecule is very advantageous. Sucrose can then be hydrolyzed thanks to the sucrase enzyme into glucose and fructose again for use or storage at other places in the plants.

In summary: Disaccharides The glycosidic bond always involves one hemiacetal group and is the key for the formation of carbohydrate dimers, and also polymers Dissacharides are small molecules which are easily soluble thanks to the many hydroxy groups and easily transportable For a very similar osmotic pressure, dissaccharides carry twice as many electrons as monosaccharides: dissaccharides are the ‘go to’ transport molecules Sucrose, a very stable molecule, non reducing sugar, is the molecule used by vascular plants to transport the products of photosynthesis (glucose and fructose) from the leaves to storage areas (both sometimes located very far apart - think about sequoias!) 4.2.3 Polyssaccharides or glycans Polysaccharides are polymers of monosaccharides linked together thanks to the glycosidic bond, forming sometimes very long chains (at least more than 10 monosaccharides, or else are referred to oligosaccharides), either linear or branched. The polysaccharide chains are also referred to as glycans, the suffix an implying a chain of monosaccharides. In glycan, the prefix glyc refers to the generic carbohydrate. The term glucan refers to a chain of glucose monomers, similarly, the term xylan, refers to a chain of xylose monomers, and so on. Polysaccharides generally have two main functions: energy storage or structure. Because of the glycosidic bond, which removes a molecule of H2O, the general formula for a large polysaccharide is more like (C6H10O5)n often with 200 &lt; n &lt; 3500. For our purpose, it is important to remember that there are three main polysaccharides: homopolysaccharides or homoglycans, i.e., long chains of the same monomers (homo: same), and heteropolysaccharides or heteroglycans, long chains of a variety of monomers (hetero: different), generally separated into hemicelluloses and pectins. 4.2.3.1 Homopolysaccharides or homoglycans Among the most important homopolysaccharides, one can distinguish starch and glycogen, which are both energy storage molecules for plants, and animals, respectively, and, cellulose which has a structure function making a lot of the plants cell walls (Figure 4.18). Figure 4.18: Starch, glycogen, and cellulose are the three main homopolysaccharides of importance for our field. Obtained from https://www.sedelco.org/cms/lib/PA01001902/Centricity/Domain/506/05_Lecture_Presentation.pdf All three molecules are polymers of α- and β D-glucoses. Starch is a polymer of α-D-glucoses linked together by carbons 1 and 4. Glycogen has essentially the same structure, although it has some branches thanks to a bond between carbon 4 and 6 (Figure 4.19). Figure 4.19: Illustration of the 1-4 links between monomers of alpha-D-glucose for starch, plus 4-6 links to form branches for glycogen, and 1-4 links between monomers of beta-D-glucose for cellulose. Obtained from https://biochemikages005.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/carbohydrates/ Before we go on on describing the molecular structure of polysaccharides, it is time to reflect on their significance at the planet scale. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on earth (Klemm et al. 2005). Thanks to the hydrogen bonds between adjacent β-D-glucose polymers, very strong cellulose microfibrils form, themselves bundled into macrofibrils, surrounded by hemicelluloses and lignin (Figure 4.20). Cellulose molecules can be hydrolyzed thanks to the cellulase enzyme, generally secreted by bacteria, although animals such as termites do produce a cellulase. Most mammals only have a limited ability to digest cellulose fibers, and even ruminants and monogastric herbivores use symbiotic bacteria to produce cellulase. Figure 4.20: Illustration of Cellulose strands surrounded by hemicellulose and lignin in plant cell walls (Department of Energy’s Genomic, 1986). So if cellulose is the most abundant molecule on earth, one needs to pause in the structure description of polysaccharides and locate where polysaccharides play a role. Cellulose is the basic structure of plant cell walls. Plant cells, are distinctively different from animal cells because of their cell wall. It is the resemblance with honeycomb cells that Robert Hooke coined the term cell for plants in 1665, the shape being well defined and distinctive thanks to the walls. The cell wall is located externally to the plasma membrane and is synthesized by the cell itself. Morphologically, the cell wall is formed by layers or sheets. All cells have at least two: middle lamella and primary wall. The middle lamella is synthetized and shared by cells that are contiguous with each other, while the primary cell wall is synthetized and belongs to each cell. In some plant cells, a third thicker layer called secondary cell wall is deposited between the membrane and the primary wall. Most of the wood in the trees correspond to the secondary cell wall (Figure 4.21) (Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego 2013) Figure 4.21: Illustration of plant cell walls. In some cells, three layers can be distinguished in the secondary cell wall: S1, S2, and S3 layers are sometimes present, each with a different orientation of its fibers of cellulose. Obtained from the Atlas of Plant and Animal Histology (Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego 2013). The outermost layer of the cell wall and the first to form is the middle lamella. It acts as a glue that binds neighboring cells. The middle lamella consists mainly of pectins, although it can be lignified in those cells that have a secondary cell wall. The primary wall consists mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins, glycoproteins. For the cells that have one, the secondary wall consists mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignins [Figure 4.22; Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego (2013); Loix et al. (2017)]. Figure 4.22: Illustration of the glycans structure of plant cells with primary wall only (A), and plant cells with both primary and secondary walls (B) (Loix et al. 2017). Of these different classes, only cellulose is well defined, consisting entirely of β-(1→4)-linked glucan chains. Pectin are highly heterogeneous polysaccharides, traditionally characterized by being relatively easily extracted with hot acid or chelators and by containing a large amount of galacturonic acid residues. Hemicelluloses traditionally comprise the remaining polysaccharides […] (Scheller and Ulvskov (2010)) 4.2.3.2 Pectins Pectins are heteroglycans based on galacturonans, or polygalaturonic acids, i.e. polymers of galacturonic acid monomers. For comparison purposes, the difference between glucose and galacturonic acid is illustrated in Figure 4.23 below. The alcohol functional group of glucose on C6 is oxidized into a carboxylic acid group, and the hydroxy on C4 changes side. The main role of pectin is to give physical strength to the plant and to provide a barrier against the outside environment (Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller 2010). Pectins also hold cells together. Fruit ripening (becoming softer) or leaf fall, are in part due to the decomposition of pectins by pectinase enzymes. Pectins also seem to play a role during seed germination, and as such also have an energy storage role, particularly thanks to the galactans and arabinans (Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller 2010; Scheller and Ulvskov 2010) Figure 4.23: Illustration of the differences between alpha-D-glucose and D-galacturonic acid monomers. Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller (2010) classify pectins in four categories (Figure 4.24): the homogalacturonans (HG), which are relatively homogeneous galacturonans, although some acetyl (-C=O-CH3) or methyl (-CH3, more details herein) groups can be added. These are the most abundant, ~65% (Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller 2010) the xylogalacturonans (XGA), for which some xylose monomers are added to the the galacturonan chain thanks to the glycosidic bonds. XGA appear to be minor components of pectins. the Rhamnogalacturonans II (RGII), which still hold the galacturonan as the basic chain, but with complicated carbohydrate chains, containing rhamnose monomers in particular. RGII appear to be minor components of pectins. and the Rhamnogalacturonans I (RGI), for which rhamnose monomers alternate between galacturonic acids and that side carbohydrate side chains of arabinans and galactans. RGI constitute between 20-35% of the pectins. Figure 4.24: Illustration of the general types of pectins. Notice that the common structure or pectin backbone (but for RGI) is the polymer of galacturonic acids, or galacturonan, to which, quite a diversity of monomers participate resulting in the large heterogeneity of these heteroglycans (Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller 2010). Again, this information is provided to expose readers to the extraordinary diversity of carbohydrates, and are not meant to be known in great details. It is important to remember that in addition to homoglycans, there are galactorunans, on which pectins are based. 4.2.3.3 Hemicelluloses Hemicelluloses are heteroglycans or heteropolysaccharides. The hemicellulose term was coined at a time when the structures were not well understood and biosynthesis was completely unknown. Hemicellulose is recognized as a group of wall polysaccharides that are characterized by being neither cellulose nor pectin and by having β-(1→4)- linked backbones of glucose, mannose, or xylose (Figure 4.25). These glycans all have the same equatorial configuration at C1 and C4 and hence the backbones have significant structural similarity (Scheller and Ulvskov 2010). For those of you who are curious about the ‘equatorial configuration’ term used here, this has to do with the steric configuration of the hydroxy groups in the cyclic configuration of monosaccharides. This was not even introduced in this chapter, although it is an important consideration for chemists to characterize carbohydrates! Figure 4.25: Illustration of the general types of hemicelluloses, which vary among species and plant groups. Notice the nomenclatures ending in -an, suggesting polysaccharides. OMe, represents methyl groups; Ac, represents acetyl groups; “Fer” represents esterification with ferulic acid (3-methoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) (after Scheller and Ulvskov 2010). The most important biological role of hemicelluloses is their contribution to strengthening the cell wall by interaction with cellulose microfibrilsand, in some walls, with lignin (e.g., Figure 4.21). All the hemicelluloses show differences in structural details between different species and in different cell types within plants (Figure 4.25). In summary: Polysaccharides Polysaccharides or glycans are formed by the polymerization of mostly hexose monomers, although pentoses are sometimes involved, via the glycosidic bond The atoms involved in the glycosidic bonds determine whether the polymer is linear or branched, and ultimately determines the type of polysaccharides The energy stored on polysaccharides is not available unless the hexoses are liberated one by one or two by two (starch → maltose) from the polysaccharides chains Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on earth present in all plant cell walls Pectins are heteroglycans based on galacturonans largely present in the primary wall of plant cells Hemicelluloses are a losely defined group with little strength present in cell walls intertwined with cellulose fibers Cellulose, pectins and hemicelluloses all agregate in plant cell walls alongside the ubiquitous lignin which stiffens the wall as we shall see. Although lignin is made of CHO, and is closely associated with polysaccharides, it technically does not belong to the carbohydrate family as its monomers are not oses, but generally phenylpropanoid, and the polymerization does not involve the glycosidic bond. For this reason, lignin is presented in section 4.6 dedicated to phenolics in this chapter. 4.2.4 Other important carbohydrates It would be erroneous to leave out some additional mono- or polyssaccharrides out as some of them play a very significant role in biology and ecology. In a way, they correspond to the exceptions that confirm or rather complete the rule. So far, we have summarized monosaccharides with the general formula (CH2O)n, to essentially be mostly C5 and C6 molecule where the average carbon is bonded to an hydroxy functional group and a hydrogen atom. And that these monosaccharides have the tendency to form 5 or 6 atom rings. Well, it turns out that on this general configuration, some of the hydroxy groups are replaced by other functional groups. The most famous one is probably is deoxybose, as it replaces ribose, as already mentioned above and illustrated again below (Figure 4.26). Figure 4.26: Replacement of a hydroxy group of ribose by hydrogen, effectively removing an oxygen atom or ‘deoxy-ing’ the ribose, hence the formation of deoxyribose Several others that need mentioning are illustrated below. The first one is glucosamine where carbon number 2 has been replaced by an amine group. Glucosamine is a precursor of glycosylated proteins and lipids (glycosylated means that a sugar is linked with a protein/lipid other substituent via a glycosidic bond). When an acetyl group is added to the amine group of a glucosamine (via an amide bond), the resulting carbohydrate is called N-acetylglucosamine (Figure 4.27). Figure 4.27: Important additional monosaccharides where the hydroxy group has been replaced by an amine and an N-acetylamine Two of these N-acetylglucosamine bonded via a glycosic bond form the monomer for chitin (Figure 4.28), i.e., the polysaccharide forming the exoskeleton of arthropods, such as crustaceans and insects, the radulae of molluscs, cephalopod beaks, and the scales of fish and lissamphibians [Wikipedia contributors (2019e); Figure 4.29]. Figure 4.28: N-acetylamine dimer forming the basis for the chitin polysaccharide that serves as exoskeleton of many invertebrates The exoskeleton of these macroinvetebrates possesses excellent mechanical properties in terms of stiffness-todensity ratio and fracture toughness (Nikolov et al. 2011). This is explained by the microstructure of the exoskeleton, and how the chitin nanofibrils are put together (Figure 4.29). Figure 4.29: Exoskeleton of the American lobster (Homarus americanus) formed by seven levels of microstrucutures of the nanofibrils of chitin, polysaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine (Nikolov et al. 2011) Deoxygenation of the alcohol group of carbon 6 of glucose yields quinovose or 6-deoxyglucose (Figure 4.30). The methyl radical can become sulfanated by a sulfo- radical, to yield sulfoquinovose. Sulfoquinovose is one of the backbone sugars for glycolipids that form the innermembrane of thylakoids in chloroplasts (more details in section 4.5.5.3). The molecule quinovose is a sugar moiety of the quinovin molecule, extracted from the bark of the tree of the cinchena genus in South America. The local Quechuan name is kina, and the new kina, is a quina nova, hence the word quinovin by contraction. And the sugar or ose of the quinovin is thus named a quinovose. Figure 4.30: Glucose, quinovose, and sulfoquinovose as important monosaccharides used as building blocks for glycolipids forming the inner membranes of thylakoids in chloroplasts Lastly, carbohydrates play a major role in the communication between cells as carbohydrates small chains are often attached to membrane proteins and lipids, in which case proteins and lipids are referred to as glycoproteins and glycolipids, respectively (more details below). Learning outcomes at the end of this section on carbohydrates, you should be able to: Monosaccharides: Recognize that each atom has on average 4 electrons for itself, making monosaccharides the ideal molecule to store and release high energy electrons Recognize that the consequence is the presence of aldehyde and ketone functional groups which allow the cyclization of pentoses and hexoses Recognize that the release of energy can only occur when they are in the aldose chain form Know that their formula is (CH2O)n where 3 &lt; n &lt; 6, generally, and the formula of glyceraldehyde Recognize that small differences in the position of hydroxy, and in the cyclization of the C5 and C6 make for different monosaccharides Recognize that thanks to all the hydroxy groups, monosaccharides are extremely soluble in water.

Etymology Corner The word proteins used in English results from the French word protéine first coined by Dutch organic and analytical chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder in an article published in 1838 (Mulder 1838), and later translated in German as Protein in 1839. Both words are based on the ancient greek πρωτειοζ or proteioz (~primary), because Mulder thought that the ‘organic acids making protéines appeared to be the primitive or principal substance that plants prepare for herbivores, which the latter provide to the carnivores’ (Mulder 1838; Hartley 1951).

This chapter is still under construction 4.4 Nucleic Acids and Nucleotides The third molecular family we choose to present are Nucleic Acids. The term nucleic acid is the overall name for the DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA) and the RiboNucleic Acid (RNA). DNA and RNA carry the genetic code and are present in every living cell on this planet (viruses seem to have some variations on that). Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides, and as such are polynucleotides. Nucleic acids are unbranched molecules that generally are very large, and in fact the longest among all macromolecules, accounting up to 247 million monomers in a human chromosome (Wikipedia contributors 2021a). It was Friedrich Miescher, Swiss physician and biologist who first isolated what he called nuclein from nuclei of white blood cells he had access to from pus-coated patient bandages (Miescher 1871). Miescher came across this “substance from the cell nuclei that had chemical properties unlike any protein, including a much higher phosphorous content and resistance to proteolysis (protein digestion). […] Miescher’s discovery of nucleic acids was unique among the discoveries of the four major cellular components (i.e., proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids) in that it could be dated precisely… [to] one man, one place, one date” (“Discovery of DNA Double Helix: Watson and Crick,” n.d.). Nucleic acids are made of the C,H,O,N, and P atoms with a relatively high concentration of N and P compared to any other molecular family. This suggests that the combined and concentrated presence of N and P makes for very special molecules. 4.4.1 Nucleotides as monomers of nucleic acids DNA and RNA are polymers of four nucleotide monomers. Each of them is made of three moeities bonded together: a phosphate, a pentose, and a nucleobase, the latter sometimes referred to as a nitrogenous base (Figure 4.31). The names of the nucleobases (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine - for DNA, and Uracil - for RNA) are sometimes used to describe the nucleotide itself, which might be confusing… Figure 4.31: The basis structure of the generic monomer of a nucleic acid is made of phosphate, pentose, and nucleobase moieties. The nucleobase in the figure is Adenine, and the pentose is a deoxyribose It is important to be able to recognize the differences between the nucleobases, nucleosides, and nucleotides. Nucleobases or otherwise named nitrogenous bases because of the large density of nitrogen atoms are divided into purines (5 N atoms for 3-4 C atoms) and pyrimidines (3 N atoms for 4-5 C atoms). Purines and pyrimidines are heteroarenes (see Figure 3.10 and section 3.1.3), that have aromatic cycles, where some of the carbon atoms have been replaced by nitrogen atoms. Adenine, Guanine, and Cytosine are common to DNA and RNA, while Thymine is only present in DNA, and Uracil only present in RNA. Both purines and pyrimidines are ‘flat’ molecules, which can be paired together thanks to hydrogen bonds (details below). Figure 4.32: The purines and pyrimidines form the nucleobase moieties of nucleotide monomers. Because of the aromatic nature of these moieties, the nucleobases are flat, allowing for pairing using hydrogen bonds After BruceBlaus, CC BY 3.0 (Blausen.com staff 2014) The condensation reaction between a nucleobase and a pentose on the 1’ carbon results in a nucleoside (Figure 4.33). To differentiate between the carbons of the nucleobases and those of the pentose, geneticists have added a “prime” or apostrophy next to the carbon number, hence the 1’ Figure 4.33. Figure 4.33: The condensation reaction between a pentose and a nucleobase on the carbon 1’ corresponds to an N-glycosidic bond and results in the formation of a nucleoside. The nucleobase in the figure is Adenine, and the pentose is a deoxyribose The condensation between a nucleoside and a phosphate moiety forms a nucleotide (Figure 4.34). The bond between the 5’ carbon of the pentose with phosphate is a phosphoester bond. Figure 4.34: The condensation reaction between a phosphate moiety and a nucleoside results in the formation of a nucleotide monomer. The bond between the phosphate and the nucleoside moieties is a phosphoester bond. The nucleobase in the figure is Adenine, and the pentose is a deoxyribose Nucleic acids are formed by the polymerization of nucleotide monomers. This polymerization is made possible thanks to the condensation between the phosphate moeity of one nucleotide with the hydroxy on 3’ of the pentose moiety of another nucleotide (Figure 4.35). The polymerization occurs at the 3’ end, of in the case of Figure 4.35 by adding a nucleotide at the bottom. The phosphate moiety in a nucleic acid chain is bonded to 2 pentose moieties and this bond is referred to as a phospho-diester bond. This bond is crucial and extremely rigid and provide what is referred to as the sugar-phosphate backbone. Figure 4.35: The condensation reaction between consecutive nucleotides between the phosphate moiety and the carbon 3’ results in the formation of a nucleic acids. The bond between the phosphate moiety and the two pentoses is a phospho-diester bond. The phosphate-pentose chain held togeter by the phospho-diester bond is referred to as the sugar-phosphate backbone. The pentose is a deoxyribose In both RNA and DNA, the sugar-phosphate backbone results in the 3D formation of α-helix molecules. In Figure 4.36, the sugar-phosphate backbone has been illustrated as a ribbon. Notice the phosphate moeiety on the outside of the ribbon forcing the nucleoside and thus the nitrogenous bases to point into the helix and stacking on top of each other. It takes about 10 polynucleotides to make a full circle. Figure 4.36: Illustration of the double-helix double-stranded molecule of DNA with 10 nucleotides polymerized for each strand 4.4.2 DNA and RNA The DeoxyriboNucleic Acids (DNA) and the RiboNucleic Acids (RNA) have several fondamental differences: the pentose for RNA is a Ribose, and for DNA it is a Deoxyribose (Figure 4.31 and 4.37) one of the pyrimidine nucleobases is only found in DNA, i.e., Thymine, and the other is only found in RNA, and that is Uracil. The difference between the two is one methyl group missing on Uracil (Figure 4.32 and 4.38) DNA is a double-stranded molecule, while RNA is single-stranded (Figure 4.38) Figure 4.37: Replacement of a hydroxy group of ribose by hydrogen, effectively removing an oxygen atom or ‘deoxy-ing’ the ribose, hence the formation of deoxyribose Figure 4.38: Differences between RNA (left) and DNA (Right) illustrating the single-stranded structure of RNA and the Uracil nucleobase, vs. the double-stranded structure of DNA and the thymine nucleobase that replaces the uracil. by Roland1952, CC BY-SA 3.0 The double helix […] double-stranded DNA, […] is composed of two linear strands that run opposite to each other, or anti-parallel, and twist together. Each DNA strand within the double helix is a long, linear molecule made of smaller units called nucleotides that form a chain. […] The two helical strands are connected through interactions between pairs of nucleotides, also called base pairs. Two types of base pairing occur: nucleotide A pairs with T, and nucleotide C pairs with G (“Double Helix,” n.d.). Figure 4.39: Two hydrogen bonds connect T to A; three hydrogen bonds connect G to C. The sugar-phosphate backbones (grey) run anti-parallel to each other, so that the 3’ and 5’ ends of the two strands are aligned. Figure and caption from (“Discovery of DNA Double Helix: Watson and Crick,” n.d.) A unique pairing between Adenine (A) and Thymine (T) nucleotides, and between Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) nucleotides in DNA, and, between Adenine and Uracil (U) during RNA transcription is at the core of the replication of the genetic code and its transcription into the synthesis of proteins. The pairing only occurs between a pyrimidine and a purine bases. This is associated with the space available within the double helix (20 Å): not enough for two purines to fit within the helix and too much space for two pyrimidines to get close enough to each other to form hydrogen bonds. The unique pairing between A and T, C and G, and A and U is possible thanks to: the sugar-phosphate backbone structure which leads the nucleotide bases to point into the helix for a diameter of 20 Å leaving enough room for a purine and a pyrimidine moeities to face each other at the center (Figure 4.36) the planar structure of the nitrogenous bases due to the aromatic rings, and the location of functional groups that place the amine and carbonyl groups outward on a same plane (Figure 4.36 and 4.32) the high electronic density associated with the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen of the carbonyl groups and the nitrogen of the amine groups that open the possibility for the creation of hydrogen bonds between (Figure 4.39) C=O····H-N N-H····N This results in the possibility of forming of three hydrogen bonds between C and G, while only two hydrogen bonds can occur between A and T, and A and U, hence the unique pairing described above. This also results in the fact that the two strands of the DNA molecule are a mirror image of each other although they run opposite or anti-parallel to each other. 4.4.2.1 Quick recall on DNA replication It is impossible to present nucleic acids structure and not presenting any of their function, although this is objectively secondary as the main goal of this chapter is to direct why living organisms need nutrients, and in what molecules these atom eventually end up. The structure of DNA is all geared towards the replication and the transcription of the genetic code. The goal here is not to give an in depth course on replication, but provide enough of the details. In simple terms, replication involves use of an existing strand of DNA as a template for the synthesis of a new, identical strand (Pray 2008). For this to happen the double helix needs first to be unwinded and maintained as such. Then DNA polymerases can add deoxynucleotides at the 3’ end.

The nucleotides are of great importance to living organisms, as they are the building blocks of nucleic acids, the substances that control all hereditary characteristics. In the two families of nucleic acids, ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA or RNA codes for the structure of proteins synthesized in the cell. The nucleotide adenosine triphosphate (ATP) supplies the driving force of many metabolic processes. Several nucleotides are coenzymes; they act with enzymes to speed up (catalyze) biochemical reactions. The nitrogen-containing bases of nearly all nucleotides are derivatives of three heterocyclic compounds: pyrimidine, purine, and pyridine. The most common nitrogen bases are the pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, and uracil), the purines (adenine and guanine), and the pyridine nicotinamide. Nucleosides are similar to nucleotides except that they lack the phosphate group. Nucleosides themselves rarely participate in cell metabolism. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is one of the components of RNA and also the organic component of the energy-carrying molecule ATP. In certain vital metabolic processes, AMP combines with inorganic phosphate to form ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and then ATP. The breaking of the phosphate bonds in ATP releases great amounts of energy that are consumed in driving chemical reactions or contracting muscle fibres. Cyclic AMP, another nucleotide, is involved in regulating many aspects of cellular metabolism, such as the breakdown of glycogen. A dinucleotide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), participates in many oxidation reactions as an electron carrier, along with the related compound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). These substances act as cofactors to certain enzymes. We have not mentioned this molecule just yet because it is a complicated molecule. Yet, it plays a crucial role in many catalytic reactions Structure of coenzyme A: 1: 3′-phosphoadenosine. 2: diphosphate, organophosphate anhydride. 3: pantoic acid. 4: β-alanine. 5: cysteamine.

W. Christie 1987). This is the best concise and satisfying definition! The scientific term “lipid” comes from the Greek “lipos” which referred to animal fat or vegetable oil. Lipids are mainly made of C and H atoms, but do also contain O, N, and P. So it is important to remember that lipids are made of CHONP. Lipids are a very heterogeneous group of molecules and are defined in part from their propensity to be soluble in non-polar solvents (no net dipole as a result of the opposing charges in the solvent molecules). In other words, lipids do not (or not easily) dissolve in water. Contrary to carbohydrates, proteins, or nucleic acids, lipids are not obvious polymers of identified and clearly defined monomers. Rather, lipids are assemblages of well identified building blocks and backbones bonded together with ester, ether, and amide bonds. There are two main types of building blocks resulting in two major types of lipids: lipids built from fatty acid blocks (acyl groups) and lipids based from isoprene building units (ringed or not isoprene groups). Because there is no polymerization, lipids are relatively small molecules compared to polysaccharides, proteins, or nucleic acids. Figure 4.40: Common everyday ingredients containing lipids. (obtained from http://blesslaboratory.com/index.php/services/oil The carbons of lipids are generally a lot more reduced (have more electrons for themselves) than the ones of carbohydrates. For the latter, there are just about as many oxygen atoms as there are carbons, as a legacy of how they are formed during photosynthesis (details in chapter 6). Because of the number of oxygen atoms and their reactivity, carbohydrates are only able to form relatively short 5 and 6 carbon monomers, which tend to readily assemble into rings. Polymerization is what allows carbohydrates to form very large molecules. Lipids aliphatic chains have almost no oxygen atoms instead, and always strategically located near the ends of the chains. Consequently, the carbons of the hydrocarbon chains are not as prompt to react together. The result is that it becomes possible to have longer hydrocarbon molecules (commonly C16 to C22, compared to C5 and C6 carbohydrates). The aliphatic chains are relatively chemically inert and interact together by low level van der Waals forces. These long aliphatic chains are the reasons for the mostly hydrophobic character of lipids (Figure 4.40). However, the fatty acid-based lipids are amphipathic (also referred to as amphiphilic), i.e., that they have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends. The hydrophobic end or hydrophobic tail corresponds to the long aliphatic chain of the fatty acid residue. The hydrophilic end or hydrophilic head is associated with the other building blocks made of ionic and polar groups that include ester and amide bonds, the backbone, and other polar radicals (details below). The amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles, multilamellar/unilamellar liposomes, or membranes in an aqueous environment (Wikipedia contributors 2019a). Overall, lipids function as essential structural components of membranes, as signalling molecules, as chemical identifiers of specific membranes and as energy storage molecules (Meer, Voelker, and Feigenson 2008). Thousands of lipid molecules have been listed and an entire scientific discipline called lipidomics is dedicated to lipids structure and function! Rigorous classifications have been proposed (e.g., Fahy et al. (2005), Fahy et al. (2009)), and gateways on lipid research and updates are available (e.g., lipidmaps). Our goal here is to present enough of what lipids are and do. Overall lipids may be divided into eight categories: fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides (derived from condensation of acyl subunits); and sterol lipids and prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits) (Wikipedia contributors 2019a) 4.5.1 Overview of fatty acid- or acyl-based lipids In this category, are included fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, saccharolipids, and sphingolipids. They all have in common the presence of long aliphatic carbon chains forming ‘tails’ of the molecules. The average carbon of a fatty acid chain is a methylene (-CH2-) such that each carbon atom has 6 electrons for itself (Figure 4.41). Consequently, lipids are, among the macromolecules, those which can store and release the most energy per carbon atom! Figure 4.41: Electron allocation of a generic fatty acyl group (CH2)n. The group -CH2- is referred to as a methelene group Lipids share with nucleic acids the ‘building block’ structure, in that they are built of identified building blocks. The quintessential acyl-based lipid is made of two fatty acids forming the hydrophobic tail end, a backbone, a phosphate or hexose, and a polar group. The two latter building blocks form the hydrophilic head, which tends to be a lot shorter than the hydrophobic end as illustrated in Figure 4.42 below. Figure 4.42: Schematic of the quintessential fatty acid based lipid illustrating the amphipathic nature, and the different building blocks From this simple construction, thousands of acyl-based lipid molecules exist following a wide variation on the fatty acids themselves, the three types of backbones, and on the polar groups (nature and number). And there are lots of exception to this general rule (e.g., Fahy et al. 2005, 2009). Nonetheless, Figure 4.43 summarizes how acyl-based lipids are constructed and how some of the classification has been derived. It reads from the bottom to top. The first stage of molecules having only one of the building blocks are the fatty acids. There are so many of them that they are classified as a lipid group by themselves. Figure 4.43: The main types of fatty acid based lipids: illustrating the common fatty acid base, and resulting from the three types of backbones and a variety of polar groups making the hydrophilic head) The second stage molecules are lipids built from fatty acids + a backbone. The backbone molecules can bind with one to three fatty acids on one side, with ester (most often), ether, or amide bonds, and with other radicals on the other side allowing more building blocks to be added. There are three main backbone molecules: glycerol, hexosamine (glucosamine in Figure 4.43), and sphingosine. Mono-, di- and triacylglycerols (previously called mono-, di-, and triglycerides, respectively) play such an important role in metabolism and energy storage, that the glycerolipids have been identified as a group of its own. Glycerolipids with additional building blocks eventually lead to the glycerophospholipid family (green in Figure 4.43). The glucosamine (hexose with an amine group) eventually leads to the saccharolipid family (blue in Figure 4.43). Sphingosine plays both the role of a backbone and of a fatty acid thanks to its long saturated aliphatic tail. Sphingosine-based lipids eventually lead to the sphingolipid family (grey in Figure 4.43). The third stage are lipid molecules built from fatty acids + a backbone + phosphate or a sugar. It is quite interesting to realize that only two molecules, phosphate or an hexose, play that role. They have enough hydroxy functional group to make ester bonds with other groups. Most glycerophospholipids have a fourth stage of building blocks, and the third stage is thus an intermediate form. Many glycolipids and sphingolipids, however, only have stage three molecules and are incorporated into cell membranes as such. The fourth stage are lipid molecules with four building blocks: fatty acids + a backbone + phosphate or a sugar + polar group. These molecules make about 50% of the cell membranes and thus play a major role in life. It is the amphipathic nature of these molecules that leads them to readily assemble into acyl lipid bilayers (generally referred to as phospholipids). The hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads tend to aggregate together forming a layer or sheet of molecules a bit like a bundle of wheat that would have the stems together and the wheat ears together. Because cells essentially are aqueous systems, the hydrophobic side of the layer is naturally unstable, unless it is stabilized by another layer of phospholipids, with the hydrophobic tails facing each other and the hydrophilic heads facing the aqueous phase of the cell (more details later). Third and fourth stage acyl-based lipids all have similar features: they have a hydrophobic tail group, and a hydrophyllic head group. As a result, they tend to naturally congregate together to form the famous lipid bilayer in which proteins and glycoproteins, serving as cell receptors, catalyzers, or exchange regulators can readily embed. In summary: Lipids, unlike other molecular families, are not polymers of monomers but are built from building blocks Fatty acid long (C16-C22) saturated or unsaturated chains are the basis of what lipids are, sterols being an exception Because there are very few oxygen atoms, carbon atoms have more electrons for themselves and lipids thus serve as energy storage for the cell and organisms Most membrane lipids are made of two fatty acids forming a hydrophobic tail, linked to a hydrophilic head, thanks to a backbone intermediate molecule It is the amphipathic nature of lipids that allow the formation of a bilayer membrane which create cell compartments and in which proteins can be inserted Time to pause in the strict biochemical description of acyl-based lipids, and spend some time to introduce an overview of the function of these lipids in cell membranes. This should make the description of these be more fascinating later on. 4.5.2 Lipids as key to cell membrane structure and function In this section, lots of concepts are thrown at the reader, whom might be a bit rebuted by so many apparently complicated names (although most of them already appear in Figure 4.43). I decided to present the membrane function first in hope of making the biochemical description of enough of the lipids more interesting. So no worries, read this as a fascinating introduction to the wonders of life, and of lipids! The first important concept to grasp is that in the lipid bilayer, the adjacent lipid molecules are not bonded together. It is thanks to their hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, and to a lesser degree thanks to electrostatic interactions, that the membrane lipids stay together and that cellular membranes exist altogether. The membrane does not have a solid crystalline nature, but rather a more fluidic nature, where molecules can freely move about within their layer or sheet. Proteins can insert themselves into this bilayer system thanks to the fluidic behavior. They too must have some amphipathic properties as well with hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends. Because proteins are inserted in a mosaic pattern, the fluidic mosaic model proposed in 1972 [Singer and Nicolson (1972); Figure 4.44] was the first accepted model to describe membrane bilayer. Figure 4.44: The fluidic mosaic model as published by Singer and Nicholson (1972). The filled circles represent the ionic and polar head groups of the phospholipid molecules, which make contact with water; the wavy lines represent the fatty acid chains which make contact which each other. The membrane is made of two layers or leaflet of lipids mirroring each other and touching each other from the fatty acid side. The integral proteins are shown as globular molecules partially embedded in, and partially protruding from, the membrane The second important concept is that the diversity of membrane lipids and their layout and interactions together allow the concurrent formation of fluidic and more rigid areas in the membrane itself corresponding to different phases. The two main phases are the liquid-disordered phase, very fluidic, almost liquid-like, and the liquid-ordered phase, more gel-like and more rigid. The liquid disordered phase is a highly fluid state in which individual lipids can move laterally across the surface of the membrane relatively unhindered. Liquid-disordered bilayers are often characterized by irregular packing of individual lipid molecules, as well as the presence of kinks in unsaturated fatty acids. These kinks effectively reduce the surface area accessible to other fatty acid chains, weakening van der Waals interactions (Membrane Phase Transitions, libretext). When the fatty acid chains are more fully extended because they are more saturated, and/or because they interact with sterols (details below), they become more fully packed and the van der Waals interactions are increased. They yields to a more rigid gel-like structure referred to as the liquid ordered phase. And guess what, this is where the proteins are also located and this makes sense because they have a more rigid structure in which to stay (Figure 4.45). Figure 4.45: Membranes show a lipidic bilayer structure with lateral heterogeneity. Some lipids associate to form more dense areas known as membrane nanodomains or lipid rafts. In these domains, some proteins are included more frequently by electrochemical affinity. Cholesterol is located among the fatty acid chains, close to hydrophilic heads of the lipids, straighten fatty acids, and provide more rigidity to the membrane. Transmembrane proteins allow communication between extracellular and intracellular environments. Carbohydrates are found in the outer monolayer of the cell membrane forming the so-called glycocalyx. In this figure, the interactions of cell membrane molecules with cytoskeleton and with extracellular matrix are not depicted [Figure and caption after Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego (2013) and Artur Jan Fijałkowski In other words, the number of unsaturated bonds in the fatty acid chains have a major impact on how fluidic the membrane is. The more unsaturated, the more kinks, and the more fluidic the membrane. Reversely, the more saturated, the less kinks, the more packed the hydrophobic tails, and the less fluidic the membrane. The addition of sterol lipids tends to generate the more rigid liquid ordered phase (Figure 4.46), and these tend to be present where the proteins are embedded in the membrane (Figure 4.45 and 4.47). Figure 4.46: Liquid-order and liquid-disorder phases in membranes due to the level of saturation of fatty acids and interactions with cholesterol and transmembrane interactions. AP- anchored protein (after Harayama and Riezman (2018)) The aggregations of lipids around proteins are referred to as membrane rafts (or lipid rafts) or membrane nanodomains (Simons and Ikonen 1997; Edidin 2003) (Figure 4.45 and 4.47). And the lipids that give the liquid-ordered gel-like phase around proteins tend to include sphingolipids and cholesterols (Simons and Ikonen 1997; Ahmed, Brown, and London 1997; Hooper 1999; Varma and Mayor 1998; Edidin 2003; Toulmay and Prinz 2013; Schmidt and Davis 2017; Sezgin et al. 2017; Harayama and Riezman 2018), phosphatidylserine and cholesterol, and phosphatidylinositol, which, thanks to their long aliphatic chains, tend to interact from one leaflet of the membrane to the other (Figure 4.46). An entire symposium on membrane raft generated this definition which highlights the importance of special lipids and their interactions with cholesterol: Membrane rafts are small (10–200 nm), heterogeneous, highly dynamic, sterol- and sphingolipid-enriched domains that compartmentalize cellular processes. Small rafts can sometimes be stabilized to form larger platforms through protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions (Pike 2006). Figure 4.47: a | Lipid raft domains are usually defined as small, highly dynamic and transient plasma membrane entities that are enriched in saturated phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycolipids, cholesterol, lipidated proteins and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. Enrichment of these hydrophobic components endows these lipid domains with distinct physical properties; these include increased lipid packing and order, and decreased fluidity. In addition to membrane components, cortical actin plays an active part in domain maintenance and remodelling. Furthermore, membrane lipids are asymmetrically distributed in the inner and outer leaflets, which may further affect membrane organization. b | It is likely that membrane organization is not binary (that is, highly distinct raft and non-raft regions), but instead membranes consist of various raft-like and non-raft domains with distinct compositions and properties. (Figure and caption from Sezgin et al. 2017) Cholesterol, a name that has been used quite a bit until now although not defined, yet, seems to play a major role in membrane rigidity around the membrane nanodomains. It seems that the amide of the sphingolipid backbone can both donate and accept a hydrogen bond, and these hydrogen bonds are within the interfacial region of the membrane, in which the relative paucity of water increases the stability of these bonds (Sezgin et al. (2017); Figure 4.48). Figure 4.48: Cholesterol can create hydrogen bond inside the water free membrane which provides additional rigidity to the membrane in lipid rafts (Figure after Sezgin et al. 2017) The third important concept is that in addition to lateral heterogeneity around membrane nanodomains, the membrane lipids assemblage dictates the curvature of the membrane and the assemblage is asymetric between the inner and outer leaflets of the membrane (reviewed by Harayama and Riezman (2018); Figure 4.49). The very nature of the membrane lipids leads to a cylindrical shape, a conical shape, or inverted-conical shapes. When assembled together, these shapes allow for membrane curvature and fission (Figure 4.49). Additionally, some membrane lipids such as PhosphatidylSerine (PS), because of the serine (an amino acid) group as the polar group, tends to bind with cytoplasm proteins like actin (considered to be the cytoskeleton, or the skeleton that keeps animal cells together). As a result, PS tends to be on the inner leaflet of the membrane. Figure 4.49: The shape of the different membrane acyl-based lipids leads to curvature of a membrane leafet, and the overall bilayer membrane results in part from the asymetric layout of the membrane lipids. SM - SphingoMyelin, PC - PhosphatidylCholine, CHOL - Cholesterol, PS - PhosphatidylSerine, PE - PhosphatidylEthanolamine, PE-O - PhosphatidylEthanolamine with ether bonds (after Harayama and Riezman (2018) and Skotland and Sandvig (2019)) The fourth and last important concept is that animal, plant, algal, or bacterial membranes do not have the same membrane lipids. Membrane lipids within an organism may differ from one organelle to the next. For example, the membranes of the thyllakoids, the organelle responsible for photosynthesis, are built with specialized galactolipids. Saccharolipids are found in bacteria only. It was impossible to leave this section about membranes without providing what is considered a realistic representation of what a membrane might look like in reality. In other words, things are a lot more complex than our brain can fully handle! Figure 4.50: Glimpse at the near future: model of the plasma membrane in full complexity. Featuring: a lipid bilayer composed of hundreds of different lipids, crowded with a large variety of embedded as well as peripherally bonded proteins, a supporting actin skeleton, a cytoplasmic site full of proteins, and realistic gradients of metabolites, ions, and pH (Figure and caption from Marrink et al. 2019) In summary: It is the amphipathic nature of membrane lipids that allows the formation of a bilayer of acyl-based lipids with the hydrophilic heads facing outwards and the hydrophobic tails facing inward Because acyl-based lipid molecules in each layer are not bonded together, the lipid molecules can move freely within the sheet Proteins are associated with membrane nanodomains where the membrane lipids have a liquid-order or gel-like phase and the membrane is more rigid. The membrane nanodomains or lipid rafts are largely enriched in membrane lipids that have straight saturated hydrophobic tails and are enriched with cholesterol It is the straight saturated hydrophobic tails of saturated acyls that shorten distances between molecules and increase van der Waals interactions, resulting in a more rigid structure. Hydrogen-binding between cholesterol and aliphatic tails add to membrane rigidity in these lipid rafts It is the unsaturated bonds in the hydrophobic tail that create kinks in most other membrane lipids, effectively maintaining larger distance between molecules, and weakening the van der Waals interactions, which in the end maintain a liquid-disordered of liquid-like phase of the membrane outside the membrane nanodomains The cylindrical or conical shape of the membrane lipids and their lateral placement dictate the curvature and shape of the membrane The presence and nature of proteins on the inner or outer side of the membrane is associated with the assymetry of the assemblages of lipids at the inner and outer leaflets of the membrane Membrane lipids composition may vary from an organism to another or with organelles within cells Now that the overview of the functions of membrane lipids is in the reader’s mind, time to enjoy some more detailed biochemistry of lipids! 4.5.3 Fatty acids: lipids of their own and primary common building blocks 4.5.3.1 Saturated and unsaturated fatty-acid chains So what are fatty acids afterall? Fatty acid are carboxylic acids with a long aliphatic chain (synonymous to long hydrocarbon chain or alkyl chain), which are either saturated (e.g., palmitic acid in Figure 4.51), mono-, or poly-unsaturated (i.e., there are at least one double bond between two consecutive carbon atoms, as illustrated in Figure 4.51; more details in section 3.1.2). The double bond in the aliphatic chain is rigid and can create ‘kinks’ in the 3D shape and their number and locations are key to their final 3D shape. Most fatty acids in nature have even number of carbons and range from 10 to 22 carbon atoms. Most present in membrane lipids have between 16 and 22 carbon atoms. Figure 4.51: Examples of saturated fatty acids (palmitic and stearic acids), mono-unsaturated oleic acid, and poly-unsaturated fatty acids exhibiting ‘kinks’, which when part of a membrane lipids, participate in the fluidic nature of the membrane. Sphingosine technically is not a fatty acid but is illustrated to show that it is straight like a saturated fatty acid. In XX:Y, XX corresponds to the number of carbon atoms, and Y corresponds to the number of unsaturated bonds. ω-3 means that the last unsaturated bond is at 3 carbons from the end (red font). The blue numbers correspond to the carbon number from the carboxyl end. EPA and DHA are abbreviations for these fatty acids. Further explanation in the text below Fatty acids have been classified according to their carbon-chain length and their level of saturation. According to their length, Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) have aliphatic chains with less than 6 carbon atoms. Even acetic acid (CH2COOH, acid of the vinegar) is classified in this category; so is butyric acid (C4) present in butter. Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6 to 12 carbons, which can form medium-chain triglycerides. Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 13 to 21 carbons. These are the typical molecules to which the generic term is often associated. Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are fatty acids with 22 or more carbons. VLCFA can represent up to a few percent of the total fatty acid content of a cell. Fatty acids are then classified depending on whether they are saturated, mono- or polysaturated, but also whether there are some methyl, cyclic, hydroxy, or nitro radicals in their chains, to name a few. This is way beyond the purpose of this book but many details can be found on the LipidWeb maintained by Dr. Christie or classified by Fahy (2005, 2009). In addition to being precursors of other lipids, fatty acids have their own metabolic role. For humans, many fatty acids play essential roles in, e.g., brain activities, cellular messengers, or have been identified to have health benefits. Two fatty acids are considered essential fatty acids for humans, i.e., that humans need them but lack the ability to synthesize them (Figure 4.52). Figure 4.52: α-linolenic acid (omega-3 acid) and linoleic acids (omega-6 fatty acid) are the two essential polyunsaturated fatty acids humans must ingest for their metabolic needs 4.5.3.2 The famous omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids The Alpha Linoleic Acid (ALA) is an omega-3 fatty acid. This very common everyday life denomination gives the opportunity to introduce some nomenclature and fascinating facets of fatty acids. As stated before, in organic chemistry in general, each carbon is given a number, carbon number 1 starting with the most important functional group. As a result, in fatty acids, the carbon of the carboxyl group is given the value “1” (blue numbers in Figures 4.51 and 4.52). In unsaturated fatty acids, the number and location of the double bond(s) are very important because, again, it influences the 3D shape of the aliphatic chains (Figure 4.51) and is reflected in the naming. So the first approach to name fatty acid is to follow organic chemistry rules. For example, linoleic acid is a 18 carbon molecule and has two unsaturated bonds. The corresponding alkane is an octadecane, octadec- prefix meaning 18. But it also is a carboxylic acid, so the suffix will be -oic. It has two unsaturated bonds, so it is a diene, di- for 2, and -ene for alkene. The placement of the unsaturated bonds are on the 9th and 12th carbon. So its name is a 9,12-octadecdienoic acid or octadec-9,12-dienoic acid!! OK, but this does not really explain the omega part. In molecules of 16 to 22 carbons, it became obvious to chemists that it was just as easy to count from the other end or methyl end (fewer carbons to count!) to locate the double bonds. So they started to also report counting from the methyl end. Since “the alpha and the omega” is a known biblical expression meaning “the beginning and the end”, the “alpha” of the fatty acid became the beginning of the aliphatic chain (i.e., carbon number 2, see α linolenic acid in Figure 4.52), and the “omega” became the end carbon of the aliphatic chain. The expression “omega-3” really means “omega minus 3”, or that the last unsaturated bond is located at three carbons from the end. But what about the other double bond(s)? How does one know where it is (they are) located? Well, it turns out that for most polyunsaturated fatty acids, the double bonds are located every 3 carbons! Such that the carbons on each side of the double bonds are in the cis configuration, or that they ‘face’ each other rather than being on the oposite side of the double bond (in which case they would be in a trans configuration, further description in section 3.1.2). So lipid chemists have come up with much simplified nomenclature and the linoleic acid would then be referred to as a 18:2(n-3). This means that the fatty acid has 18 carbons, has 2 unsaturated bonds, the last one is the third carbon from the end (n-3, n replaces ω in most modern naming). And because there are no further precisions, all the double bonds are in a cis configuration and therefore the other double bond is at an (n-6) location. Voilà! The omega-3 fatty acids are a gateway to health sciences and medicine! Briefly, the two essential fatty acids cited above serve as precursor to other very important fatty acids. The first notable one is the arachidonic acid (20:4(n-6)). The name arachidonic acid suggests that this acid is particularly present in peanut oil. You should now be able to write its formula before you check it out and verify it from Figure 4.51! Arachidonic acid is the preponderant fatty acid included in the membrane phospholipids. It is also the presursor of very important C20 and C22 fatty acids, building blocks of membrane phospholipids of the brain. In fact, there is high probability that you might have heard about the EPA (eicosapentenoic acid 20:5(n-3), eicos- meaning 20, -penten- meaning five double bonds), and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid 22:6(n-3); docos- meaning 22, -hexaen- meaning six double bonds). With ALA, EPA and DHA are the most talked and researched after omega-3 lipids!! And indeed, there are lots of evidence that these omega-3 are good for human health (e.g., Kris-Etherton, Hecker, and Binkoski 2004). Many conjugated (i.e., alternating single and double bonds; double bonds in trans configuration) polyunsaturated fatty acids have also recently been reported to have health benefits (e.g., Pariza, Park, and Cook 2000; Kris-Etherton, Hecker, and Binkoski 2004; Benjamin and Spener 2009) . Because arachidonic acid is so widely needed and available, it is also the precursor of an entire family of fatty acid derivatives referred to as the eicosanoid lipids (eicos- meaning 20, -oid meaning “like” or “derivatives”). These are oxidated fatty acids (then referred to as oxylipins) that serve as cellular messengers in mammalians. Their names might be familiar and include prostaglandins (vasodilators) or thromboxanes (vasoconstrictors). In summary: Fatty acids are carboxylic acids so technically even acetic acid (C2) or butyric acid (C4, in butter) are fatty acids. Their hydrophobicity comes from their relative long aliphatic chains (C10 and up) Saturated fatty acids have straight aliphatic chains and take little 3D space The number and placement of unsaturated (C=C) bonds dictates their 3D shapes from a simple kink like in oleic acid to almost snail like shape for DHA When a moeity of membrane acyl-based lipids, the nature and therefore shape of the fatty acids dictates the fluidity or rigidity of the membrane 4.5.4 Glycerolipids for energy storage Nearly all the commercially important fats and oils of animal and plant origin consist almost exclusively (&gt;95%) of the simple lipid class - triacylglycerols, which are chemically inert, highly hydrophobic and have a high energy density. This includes all the vegetable oils, such as those from corn (maize), olive, palm, and sunflower, and animal fats, such as tallow, lard and butter, as well as commercial products such as margarines (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Figure 4.53: Formation of triacylglycerols by esterification of three fatty acids to a glycerol backbone Triacylglycerols are the quintessential model for the fat lipids (e.g., Figure 4.40). They are assemblages of long chain fatty acids esterified to a glycerol backbone (Figure 4.53). Fatty acids very loosely represent the equivalent of monomers in lipids, but the ester bonds do not represent true polymerization as the fatty acids are not directly bonded together, but are bonded to a backbone instead. Glycerolipids give the opportunity to reintroduce the term moiety. In a triacylglycerol, the glycerol moiety refers to as the part of the triacylglycerol that comes from the glycerol, illustrated in red in Figure 4.53. Lipids and nucleic acid monomers are assemblages of recognizable building blocks and each block in the final molecule is referred to as a moiety. The other moieties of triacylglycerol are the fatty acids. There is an entire classification of triacylglycerols depending on which glycerol atom is bonded to which fatty acid. But that is beyond what is needed here. The word triacylglycerol has been preferred over the older triglycerides. The equivalent of glycerolipids for the sugar backbone and sphingosine are covered in the sections below dedicated to saccharolipids and sphingolipids, respectively. 4.5.5 Glycerophospholipids or phospholipids for cell membranes 4.5.5.1 Phosphatidic acids as first type of third stage molecules The next stage of building blocks after the glycerolipids is the addition of a phosphate moiety to a diacylglycerol via a phosphoester bond with the remaining hydroxy group of the glycerol moiety (Figure 4.54) to form phosphatidic acid. This molecule is an intermediate molecule for the synthesis of glycerophospholipids, built from the addition of, a least, another polar group building block. Figure 4.54: Formation of phosphatidic acid by esterification between a diacylglycerol and a phosphate Notice that because phosphoric acid has three hydroxy groups, it can theoretically make up to 3 ester bonds. In reality, this does not happen in organic molecules for several reasons. First, the tetrahedral shape of phosphate renders difficult the possibility of binding three aliphatic chains. Second, the electronic resonance makes the third hydroxy much less attractive to forming bonds when the two others are already involved in bonds. So, for the vast majority of cases, phosphates can only form up to two phosphoester bonds. Phosphatidic acid has two hydroxys available for additional binding, and one of them is used to bind with the fourth stage building blocks constituted by polar groups. The phosphatidic acid becomes a substituent to the polar group and the resulting molecules are then referred to as phosphatidyl polar group name. These are the famous phospholipids that make the majority of the membrane bilayer of most plants, animals and bacteria. Another group called the glycolipids have a sugar instead of a phosphate moiety on the third stage. They are treated separately after the four stage phospholipid molecules below. 4.5.5.2 The main membrane phospholipids The quintessential phospholipid is illustrated in Figure 4.42 and is the single unit of the membrane bilayer. Again, it is thanks to its hydrophobic double tail and its hydrophylic head that the phospholipids assemble into phospholipid sheets and into phospholipid bilayers. Two of the glycerol backbone carbons are linked to fatty acids, and the third to the phosphate moeity. There are three theoretical possibilities for this assemblage. In reality, it turns out that the placement of the fatty acyl and the phosphate ester bonds on the glycerol backbone is anything but random. Chemists have thus given stereospecific numbering or sn to represent this fact. The word stereospecific has to do with the 3D configuration as rendered by the Fisher projection of the glycerol. But for us, the important fact is that the carbons of the glycerol are numbered and that the phosphate moeity is always bonded to the third carbon or is on sn-3. The only exception is the lysobisphosphatidic acid, where the phosphate moiety is on sn-1 (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Interestingly, on the first carbon of the glycerol, or on sn-1 the fatty acyl is most often saturated, and it is on the second carbon, or sn-2 that unsaturated fatty acyls may be found. This is why in all the previous figures that represented phospholipids with a bead for the hydrophilic head and lines for the tails, there always is one of the tails represented as straight, illustrating the saturated fatty acyl on sn-1 and the second tail is either straight or kinked representing the saturated or unsaturated fatty acyl, respectively, on sn-2. The diversity of phospholipids results primarily from the different assemblages of the fatty acyl on sn-1 and sn-2, and on the polar group of the hydrophilic head. There are additional phospholipids that do not strictly follow this 4-stage molecular assemblage (details below). It turns out that although there is an almost infinite number of possible combinations, in practice, some polar groups combine with a limited number of saturated and unsaturated acyl groups. Figure 4.55: Variety of phospholipids showing the five most common polar groups and fatty acyls that tend to be preponderant for each of the polar groups. The fatty acyls on sn-1 is represented as saturated as is most often the case, and the unsaturated fatty acyls on sn-2 are represented as straight aliphatic chains although there are not in reality Among the 4-stage phopsholipids, there are five well identified polar groups, which include ethanolamine, serine, choline, inositol, and glycerol. Because each of these polar groups are bonded to phosphatidic acid via a phosphoester bond, they are called, respectively, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdE), phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), phosphatidylcholine (PtdChl), phosphatidylinositol (PtdIno), and phosphatidylglycerol (Figure 4.55). Phosphatidylcholine (PtdChl) is the most abundant lipid in the membranes of animal tissues; it is often a major lipid component of plant membranes, but only rarely of bacteria. With the other choline-containing phospholipid, sphingomyelin, it is a key structural component and constitutes much of the lipid in the external monolayer of the plasma membrane of animal cells especially (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Choline is an ethanolamine (see below) for which the amine group is in its cationic from (i.e., -NH3+) and where the hydrogens have been replaced by methyl groups to create (-N(CH3)3+). The positive charge on the nitrogen is compensated by the negative charge on the phosphate, making PtdChl a neutral phospholipid. The fatty acids on sn-1 tend to be 16:0 and 18:0 for both animal and plant cells, and 18:1 and 18:2 on sn-2 (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.), so relatively small number of unsaturated bonds compared to other phospholipids. PtdChl is rarely being found in bacteria, although it is often the main complex lipid in eukaryotes (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdE) is usually the second most abundant phospholipid class in animal and plant tissues, and it can be the major lipid class in microorganisms (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Ethanolamine corresponds to an ethane or C2 with one hydroxy group (-OH) on one carbon making ethanol, and an amine group (-NH2) on the second carbon; the two combined is called ethanolamine. It is bonded to the phosphate via a phosphoester bond. The amine group in PtdE tends to be in its cationic form, making PtdE also a neutral phospholipid. The fatty acids tend to mimic those of PtdChl although there is a higher proportion of polyunsaturated (e.g., 20:4) acyls on sn-2 for animal cells. PtdE is often the most abundant lipid class in many bacterial species and may be accompanied by phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylglycerol (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) is a weakly acidic lipid that is present in most tissues of animals and plants and is also found in microorganisms. Under normal conditions, it is located entirely in the inner monolayer leaflet of the plasma membrane and other cellular membranes (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Serine is an amino-acid (details in section 4.3) and tends to readily bind to proteins within and outside the membrane with cytoplasmic proteins such as actins making the cytoskeleton of animal cells. The fatty acids on sn-1 tend to be 18:0 for animal cells, and be long polyunsaturated 20:4 and 22:6 on sn-2 (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.), so relatively high number of unsaturated bonds compared to other phospholipids. Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIno) is a common constituent of animal, plant and microbial lipids. Inositol is an interesting carbohydrate: it is a cyclohexane, for which each carbon has been oxidized and lost a hydrogen for a hydroxy (-OH). So it has six alcohol groups or is an hexol, with the same general formula as glucose, i.e. C6H12O6. Glucose has an aldehyde group on its 6th carbon and is thus different. In animal tissues, the characteristic feature of fatty acids is a high content of stearic (18:0) and arachidonic (20:4) acids. The long tails of arachidonic acids from PtdIno on both sides of the membrane seems to be able to form hydrogen bonds, participating in the liquid-ordered phase of membranes (e.g., Figure 4.46). The hydroxy groups of inositol react with phosphate to from inositol mono-, bi- or even tri-phosphates, all of which PtdIno play, in animal cells, important signalling and other functional activities, including cell communication via signal transduction, cell survival and proliferation, membrane trafficking and modulation of gene expression (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Phosphatidylinositols also serve as anchors to proteins (see protein anchor in Figure 4.45) in animal cells. While the previous phospholipids are common in eukaryot cells, bacterial cells tend to have different types and proportions of phospholipids. Phosphatidylglycerol is a lipid present in the three kingdoms of life although it is a major component of some bacterial membranes. The charge on the phosphate group means that it is an anionic lipid at neutral pH with a larger head group than might be expected because of hydration and with a cylindrical shape overall. Phosphatidylglycerol is found in almost all anaerobic bacterial types, representing 20-25% of the phospholipids in most Gram-negative bacteria, i.e. with a double (outer and inner) phospholipid envelope, where it is present only in the inner membrane. In Gram-positive bacteria, which have a single phospholipid bilayer coated with peptidoglycans, it can be as high as 60% of the phospholipids (together with glycosyl diacylglycerols). In cyanobacteria and plants that are able to carry out aerobic photosynthesis, phosphatidylglycerol is found in all cellular membranes - 2 to 5% of the plasma membrane. In bacteria, phosphatidylglycerol especially is widely distributed and it is found in most genera; uniquely it is the only glycerophospholipid in the membranes of certain cyanobacteria (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). The last of the phospholipids presented here is cardiolipin, which was originally found in animal heart tissue (Figure 4.55). It can be seen as the condensation of two phosphatidylglycerol molecules into one. Cardiolipin is present universally in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes where it represents an important phospholipid component of specific membranes in those organelles whose function is to generate an electrochemical potential for substrate transport and ATP synthesis. Thus, it is found almost exclusively in certain membranes of bacteria (plasma membrane and hydrogenosomes) and a few species of Archaea (haloarchaea), and in mitochondria of eukaryotes (up to 20% of phospholipids) (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). This phospholipid is rather negative thanks to the two negative charges of the phosphate, which may explain its role in maintaining electrochemical potentials across the membranes (see Chapter 5). There are other phospholipids described in exhaustive classifications, but this is beyond the scope of this book. Additional references include the LipidWeb, Fahy et al. (2005) and Fahy et al. (2009) as good starters. Phospholipids by definition involve phosphate as a central moiety between the backbone and the polar group. This is one of the reasons for which phosphorus and phosphate in particular are so essential for life to exist on this planet. However, we will see that phosphorus in reality is not readily available in many areas of our planet and this is why it has historically been a limiting nutrient on our planet for the longest time. This has recently changed (since the late 1950s) thanks to the mining and manufacturing of artificial fertilizers. However, because phosphorus was in so short supply, organisms have found ways to still build their membranes using the building block principle, but without using phosphate, and using hexoses instead. 4.5.5.3 Glycosyldiacylglycerols or where phosphates are replaced by sugars The title is a bit of a mouthful, one has to admit… But the idea here is that instead of a phosphate in phosphatidic acid, the diacylglycerol moiety is bonded to a sugar via a glycosidic bond. The sugar moeity, because it is linked via this glycosidic bond is called a glycosyl group, hence the name (Figure 4.56). Sugars have multiple hydroxides hence possibilities to make bonds with other hydroxides, and in this case with the last hydroxide available on the glycerol backbone of diacylglycerols. Figure 4.56: Formation of a glycosyldiacylglycerol by binding a galactose to a diacylglycerol moiety using a glycosidic bond to form the majority of the innerside of the membrane lipids of thylakoids in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria The sugars acting as backbones are galactose or digalactose (two galactoses bonded by a glycosidic bond), but also a sulfoquinovose presented in the carbohydrate section and glucuronic acid (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). The three glycolipids illustrated in Figure 4.57 are the membrane lipids essential to photosynthetic tissues in both higher plants and cyanobacteria. In fact these three account for more than 85% of the membrane lipids in thylakoids of plant plastids and cyanobacteria (Kobayashi 2016). These glycoglycerolipids are equivalent to and may substitute for phosphoglycerolipids, especially when the supply of phosphorus is restricted (Essigmann et al. 1998; Güler et al. 1996). In fact, these glycolipids are the most abundant lipid classes in leaf (photosynthetic) tissues (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Figure 4.57: Three main glycolipids that make the majority of the innerside of the membrane lipids of thylakoids in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria In summary: Phospholipids are the core molecules that form membranes that allow compartmentalization in cells essential to life as they regulate exchanges and allow formation of gradients This is possible thanks to the unique assemblage of two long chain fatty acids on a glycerol backbone forming the hydrophobic side, and on the other side, a phosphate and a polar group resulting in a hydrophilic side The overall charge of the phospholipids depend on whether the negative charge of the phosphate is balanced or not by the charge of the positive charge of the polar group. Phosphatidylcholine is the most common phospholipid in eukaryot and prokaryot cells. Some organelles and cells can contain high proportion of specific phopholipids like the cardiolipin in organelles maintaining electrochemical potentials across the membrane There is a relative correlation between the fatty acid types and the polar groups Phosphate limited environments have lead certain bacteria and cyanobacteria to develop fatty acylglycerol-based membrane lipids that use sugars instead of phosphates 4.5.6 Sphingolipids use sphingosine as backbone/fatty acid The second major type of acyl-based lipids are called sphingolipids. From their original discovery from brain cells in the 1880s to modern times, sphingolipids have shown some enigmatic traits (Thudichum 1884; Merrill et al. 1997; Spiegel and Milstien 2003). The original building block is sphingosine (C18). This molecule originally discovered in brain has many of the traits of saturated fatty acids because of its long saturated aliphatic chain, yielding the same hydrophobic properties of fatty acid tails. Carbons 1 and 3 are oxydized into alcohol groups, carbon 2 has an amine group, while there is a double bond between carbons 4 and 5 (Figure 4.58). The amine group can react with the carboxyl group of a fatty acid to form an amide bond, to form ceramide, which is the equivalent of diacylglycerol or second stage molecules described above. The prefix cer- in ceramide has its roots in the word cerebral, for brain, following the early discoveries. The amide bond is rather rigid thanks to the partial double bond between the amine and the carbonyl functional groups (details in section 3.2.12), which reduces the aliphatic chain fluctuations. This with the added rigidity thanks to cholesterol molecules (details in section 4.5.11 below), shortens the intermolecular distances between sphingomyelin molecules and facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds between them thereby promoting the formation of a hydrogen bond network and a stable ordered phase (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). The hydroxy group on carbon 1 can bind with polar groups such as phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine, or sugars (Figure 4.58). As a result, sphingosine serves as a backbone because it can bind with a fatty acid on the hydrophobic tail end and with a polar group to form a hydrophilic head. Sphingosine also plays the role of a second fatty acid thanks to its hydrophobic saturated tail. Sphingosine is the most prevalent of the many (over one hundred!) sphingoid bases that have been identified, which differ depending on the number of carbons, whether there are two (or d- for di-) or three (or t- for tri-) hydroxy groups, and whether there is, and the location of, a unsaturated C=C double bond, to keep it short. Sphingosine has its unsaturated bond between carbons 4 and 5, and in the trans or E (for German Entgegen) configuration (details in section 3.1.2). Sphingosine is thus abbreviated as 4E-d18:1, meaning 4E for unsaturated bond starting on carbon 4 with the Entgegen configuration, d because there are two hydroxys on C1 and C3 (the amine group is always on C2 in sphingoid bases), 18:1 for a C18 aliphatic chain overall and one unsaturated bond. For example, bases include dihydrosphingosine which is a d18:1, phytosphingosine which is a t18:1, and dehydrophytosphingosine which is a 7E-t18:1 (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Figure 4.58: Illustration of sphingolipids and their building blocks. A fatty acid added to sphingosine, forms ceramide. Addition of phosphoethanolamine and phosphocholine polar groups form sphingomyelins, or the addition of sugar(s) form glycosphingolipids (or glucosylceramides) Many polar groups have been identified for sphingolipids including phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine, for which the resulting lipids are called sphingomyelins. Sugar based polar groups form a great variety of molecules referred to as glycosphingolipids that are very important in brain tissues. More generally, however, sphingolipids play a very important role in the membrane nanodomains, where in conjuction with cholesterol, form the liquid-ordered, gel-like phase, membrane proteins are inserted (details in section 4.5.2). The fatty acids of sphingolipids are very different from those of glycerolipids, consisting of very-long-chain (up to C26) odd- and even-numbered saturated or monoenoic (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). This additionally renders the ceramide residue to have a cylindrical shape (Figure 4.51), which, in conjunction with hydrogen bonding between cholesterol and the sphingoid base residues, increase the van der Waals electrostatic forces, and favor the liquid-ordered phase of the membrane nanodomains. Finally, sphingolipids play an important, yet still relatively enigmatic, signalling function in animal organisms (Spiegel and Milstien 2003). Etymology Corner The prefix sphingos- in sphingosin or in sphingolipids is the genitive of sphinx in Greek. In Greek mythology, the sphinx is a female monster with the body of a lion, the head and breast of a woman, eagle’s wings, and a serpent’s tail. She dwelt outside the city of Thebes, and asked a riddle to all travellers, in order to let them pass and would eat those who could not answer the riddle. While working on the chemistry of the brain, the German-born British chemist J. L. W. Thudichum discovered this new type of molecules and in particular sphingosine, which presented many enigmas to its discoverer. “In commemoration of the many enigmas, which it presented to the inquirer, I have given the name of Sphingosin” (Thudichum 1884). 4.5.7 Saccharolipids in bacterial membranes The last group of acyl-based lipids include saccharolipids, where the backbone for attaching the acyl chains are sugars, namely glucosamines and sometimes glucosamine disaccharides or sugar dimers (hence the prefix saccharo- for sugar backbone, by opposition to glycero- for glycerol backbone in glycerolipids; Fahy et al. (2005)). What a mouthful, yet again…! The most infamous saccharolipid is commonly referred to as Lipid A and is the part of endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria that is inserted in outer monolayer of the outer membranes (Raetz and Whitfield 2002). Endotoxins are toxins for most animals. They are attached to the bacteria membranes themselves, as opposed to exotoxins that are released by bacteria in their environments. When bacterial cells are lysed by the mamalian immune system, fragments of membrane containing lipid A are released into the circulation, causing fever, diarrhea, and possible fatal endotoxic shock (also called septic shock). The Lipid A moiety is a very conserved component of the endotoxins. However Lipid A structure varies among bacterial species and Lipid A structure defines an overall host immune activation, sometimes violent (Wikipedia contributors 2019f). In other words, saccharolipids are bad news if they get into the blood systems of mammals… Figure 4.59: Chemical structure of lipid A as found in E. coli, and its place in the a bacterial endotoxin. Notice the two glucosamine bonded together and four fatty acids on one of them and two on the second. After Mike Jones For our purpose here, saccharolipids and lipid A in particular (Figure 4.59) have the same basic structure of a hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. The role of the hydrophobic tail is fulfilled by fatty acids. The hydrophilic head is fulfilled by the the glucosamine and the two phosphates. Lipid A corresponds to the part of endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria that is embedded in the membrane (Figure 4.59). Endotoxins, built from a lipid anchor and a polysaccharide chain are referred to as lipopolysaccharides, a mix between carbohydrates and lipids really. In summary: Sphingolipids play an analog role as those of phospholipids in the membrane. The saturated aliphatic chain of sphingosine results in a straight aliphatic chain, as opposed to kinks observed in unsaturated fatty acids This associated with the amide bond between sphingosine and the saturated fatty acyl group generates ceramides, equivalent of diacyl-glycerols, which tend to be rather cylindrical in shape taking much less space in the membrane and less prone to move The accumulation of Sphingolipids, with that of cholesterol, near membrane nano-domains creates the conditions for the presence of liquid-ordered or gel-like phase in which membrane proteins can insert Saccharolipids are only present in bacteria membranes where they readily insert in the phospholipids membrane because of similar amphipathic properties 4.5.7.1 Other acyl-based lipids of biogeochemical significance In addition to saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl moeities, other configurations of fatty acids play an important role in the fluidity of the membrane, but they only concern prokaryotic cells, some of which of biogeochemical significance. Some fatty acids are called branched fatty acids as they have methyl groups along their aliphatic chains. s and This results in less packing of the membrane, and therefore a higher fluidity of the membrane (e.g., Poger, Caron, and Mark 2014). Figure 4.60: Examples of branched fatty acyl chains commonly found in bacterial membranes. The PPC letters stand for Palmitoyl PhosphoCholine, and the number-letter prefix varies depending on the presence, location, and number of methyl groups. (Further details in Poger, Caron, and Mark (2014)) Others are called cyclic chain fatty acids, where rings of cyclopropane (C3), cyclobutane (C4), up to cycloheptane (C7), are inserted at the ω end of the fatty acids (Figure 4.61). The effects of these ringed tails, as they increase space between fatty acid chains seem to increase the membrane fluidity, particularly for the unsaturated rings. However, the large saturated rings (C6 or C7), because of the space they take and the lack of electronic resonance, seem to reduce their own mobility, thereby reducing the overall fluidity of the membrane around them (Poger and Mark 2015b). Figure 4.61: ω-Alicyclic Fatty Acids, i.e. cyclic rings inserted in the ω position of the fatty acyl moiety having 3 to 7 carbons in the ring (from Poger and Mark (2015b)) Cyclopropane inserted within the fatty acid chains do tend to create higher fluidity of bacteria membrane (e.g., Grogan and Cronan 1997; Poger and Mark 2015a, 2015b). Some cyclopropene fatty acids have been observed in plants cells as well. They seem to inhibit desaturation during the synthesis of fatty acids and pheromones in insects and so may protect plants against insect attack (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Figure 4.62: Examples of cyclopropane fatty acids found in bacterial membranes. The PPC letters stand for Palmitoyl PhosphoCholine, and the number-letter prefix varies depending on the presence, location, and number of cyclopropane groups. (Further details in and after Poger and Mark (2015a)) Anammox bacteria, of the order of Planctomycetales, have recently been recognized to possibly have a major biogeochemical role as they can oxidize ammonium under anaerobic conditions (details in section 9.2). Ladderane lipids (named after the word ladder because of their shape) were reported in 1999, as part of the membrane lipids of the anammoxosome organelle of anammox bacteria (Sinninghe Damsté et al. 2002). These C17-C20 ladderane lipids contain three linearly concatenated cyclobutane rings and one cyclohexane or five cyclobutane rings (X and Y, respectively, in Figure 4.63). Ladderane fatty acids are esterified with methanol or the glycerol backbone, and the ladderane alcohols are ether-linked with glycerol, all in different combinations (Figure 4.63). First, these lipids seem not to have a phosphate or other polar moiety. Second, they readily assemble into very compact ladderane lipid sheets (right side of Figure 4.63), which has been surmized to largely lower the diffusion of toxic byproducts such as hydrazine (N2H4) and hydroxyamine (NH4OH) from the anammoxosome. Figure 4.63: Ladderane lipids as described in 1999 account for about 50% of the membrane lipids of the anammoxisomes. They are thought to assemble into very compact lipid sheets, giving rise to an exceptionally dense membrane, thus a tight barrier against diffusion, allowing the oxidation of ammonium under anaerobic conditions to proceed. After (Sinninghe Damsté et al. 2002) Archeabacteria, considered as the first phylogenic organism group, and now considered as one of the three groups with eubacteria and eukaryots, have membrane acyl-based lipids where the hydrophobic tails are bonded to the hydrophilic backbone through ether bond, and not ester bonds anymore (De Rosa and Gambacorta 1988). Additionally, their fatty acids are built upon isoprenoid chains (further details on isoprenoids in section 4.5.10), i.e., in this case saturated chains methylated every 4 carbons. This must affect the fluidity of the membrane. Figure 4.64: Isoprenoid diethers basic components of some complex lipids of archaebacteria (De Rosa and Gambacorta 1988) Possibly more surprising and showing how cell membranes evolved, the core membrane lipids of archeobacteria are bipolar amphipatic molecules with ‘fused’ hydrophobic isoprenoid tails, bonded with ether bonds to the hydrophilic heads on opposite sides to form isoprenoid tetraethers, and, have cyclic rings inserted in the isoprenoid tails. This can only add rigidity to the membrane, a feature that is obtained in eukaryotic cells with sphingolipids combined with cholesterol lipids. Figure 4.65: Isoprenoid tetraethers basic components of some complex lipids of archaebacteria (De Rosa and Gambacorta 1988) but cyclobutane rings seem to create higher membrane compaction (Moss et al. 2018, more details in section 4.5.13.3). Other fatty acids are oxidated and have hydroxy groups, others have one or several triple bonds (acetylenic fatty acids), while others have nitro groups added. This is a bit anecdotal here but more details may be found on the LipidWeb. 4.5.8 Summary about the acyl-based-lipids Broadly, acyl-based lipids are at the basis of cell membrane formation, and serve as the energy storage molecules in organisms. Their long mostly-saturated aliphatic chains are able to store many electrons, which are physically stored as triacylglycerols in organisms as there are few free fatty acids. The long aliphatic chains are the reasons for the general hydrophobicity of lipids. The magic of these fatty acids (and sphingosine tails) is their ability to bind with more polar groups such as phosphate, choline, inositol, etc., thanks to a molecular backbone, giving many of the acyl-based lipids their amphipathic nature. This is the basis of all compartmentilization in living cells by the phospholipid bilayer, allowing for the creation of gradients, exchanges, barriers, etc., all needed to form organisms of several to billions of cells that need to interact and communicate together. This concludes the part on acyl-based lipids. The next part explores the lipids which structures are originally based on chains of isoprene subunits. They play a complementary role of acyl-based lipids in membranes and play a major role as messengers, e.g., in the form of vitamins and hormones. 4.5.9 Overview of the isoprene-based lipids 4.5.9.1 Isoprenoids built from isoprene subunits Everyone has heard about steroids. And everyone has heard about cholesterol. These are sterol-based lipids. They belong to a larger group of molecules, which includes prenol-based and steroid-based lipids, which have isoprene units as their common molecular skeleton. So no, you did not read monomer, you read unit, but honestly it would be tempting to use the term isoprene monomer and polymerization of isoprenes to form isoprenoid molecules or terpenes (literally derivatives of isoprenes) and their derivatives which include prenol-based and steroid-based lipids. If you thought that the acyl-based lipids were complicated, think again, because prenol-based and steroid-based lipids will take you to the next level in the intricacy of lipid chemistry! At the same time, it really is fascinating and it opens the doors to molecules and name we have all heard about: vitamins or essential oils. Etymology Corner The words isoprene and terpene have rather convoluted etymologies. In 1860, the English scientist and analytical chemist Charles Greville Williams analyzed caoutchouc and gutta percha (latex from the Palaquium tree) by destructive distillation and obtained a large quantity of a light oil which he termed isoprene (Williams 1860). The term isoprene can be analyzed from iso- (“equal; different, isomeric”) + prop- (“three carbon prefix”) + -ene (“alkene suffix”). It is really unclear how Williams came up with this name. This is an unfortunate misnomer. The word terpene is derived from the word “terpentine”, an obsolete form of the word “turpentine” (Wikipedia contributors 2019h). The latter seems to come from the Latin/French térébenthine, and Greek terebenthos (τ ε ρ ε β ι ́ ν θ ι ν ο ς), referring to the resin of the terebinth tree Pistacia terebinthus, which produces the pistachio nut. Turpentine resins, secreted by resinous trees to protect wounds or cuts in the trunks, has been harvested throughout the world. The one harvested from the long leaf pines (Pinus lacustris) of the coastal plain of the Eastern USA was highly sought after from the 17th to 19th centuries. It made the wealth of cities like Wilmington, N.C., along with tar and pitch (sticky liquids produced by burning pine branches and logs very slowly in kilns (History 2012)) used in the naval industry. The pine resin, after purification and distillation, separates into a liquid aromatic part, turpentine or oil of turpentine, and a solid part called rosin or colophony. Rosin is extensively used (among many others) for its friction-increasing capacity, particularly on bow hair of string instruments so it can grip the strings and make them speak, or vibrate clearly. Turpentine oil was used in making paint, paint thinner, and various medicines (History 2012). Many terpene molecules described in this chapter are present in the oil of turpentine. So isoprene is a C5 double unsaturated molecule (Figure 4.66), which animals and plants produce, the latter to protect leaf cells against extreme heat. It turns out that it is the assemblage of two isoprene units bonded to a pyrophosphate (called geranyl pyrophosphate - GPP; Figure 4.66) that is the beginning of many isoprenoids, otherwise also named terpenes (etymology explained above). 4.5.10 Prenol or isoprenoid lipids The name for the family comes from the alcohol version of isoprene, called prenol (Figure 4.66), where the hydroxy group takes advantage of the original double bond on the tail of the molecule (carbon 4; Figure 4.66), which relocates the remaining double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (Figure 4.66). Geranyl pyrophosphate is at the basis of many polyprenols and just about all terpenes. Polyprenols play an important function acting as natural bioregulators and are found in small quantities in various plant tissues (Wikipedia contributors 2019c). Figure 4.66: Isoprene and prenols; Geranyl pyrophosphate is the precursor of most terpenes or isoprenoids. Geranyl pyrophosphate is formed from DiMethylAllyl PyroPhosphate (DMAPP) and its isomer Isopentanyl PyroPhosphate (IPP) 4.5.10.1 Many familiar isoprenoids Isoprenoids or terpenes have several important characteristics: they tend to be very aromatic, have the tendency to not stay as straight molecules as depicted in Figure 4.66, but rather to fold into carbon rings. Figure 4.67: Examples of two monoterpenes formed by the propensity of prenols to form cycles. After Fred the Oysteri and Hbf878 Because geranyl-pyrophosphate is the initial building block of most terpenes, and because it has two isoprene units (Figure 4.66), terpenes tend to have even numbers of isoprene units (although there are many isoprenoids with odd numbers of isoprene units, e.g. Table 4.2). Hemiterpenes, Monoterpenes, Sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, and tetraterpenes respectively refer to isoprenoids with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 isoprene subunits (Table 4.2). Table 4.2: Examples of common terpenes and terpenoids. Terpenoids are derivatives of terpenes as they contain additional oxygen atoms, while terpenes only contain C and H atoms. Isoprene subunits are illustrated in alternating red and blue Terpene type Examples Hemiterpenoids (half-terpene) Monoterpenoids Sesquiterpenoids (one &amp; a half terpene) Diterpenoids Triterpenes Tetraterpenes The propensity of prenols to form cycles is at the basis of the formation for example of the lanosterol, precursor of all steroid lipids, from squalene (a common oil found in shark liver; Table 4.2 and Figure 4.71). Vitamin A (retinol) is a bi-product of β-carotene, both of which exhibit carbon rings (Table 4.2). Carotene is a photosynthetic pigment important for photosynthesis absorbing in the ultraviolet, violet, and blue light and scatter orange or red light, and (in low concentrations) yellow light. Carotene is responsible for the orange color of the carrots (hence its name) and many other fruits and vegetables. As a precursor to vitamin A, carotenes, must be ingested by humans. Xanthophylls are photosynthetic pigments giving the yellow color, even in egg yolk, located mostly in leaves where they act to modulate light energy. They are very close to, and essentially are oxygenated versions of carotenes (Table 4.2). The cycling propensity of isoprenoids also exist for many aromatic terpenes referred to as essential oils. Contrary to what the word essential means for fatty acids or amino acids, i.e., that humans do not synthesize them and must be acquired through food, essential oils refer to the propensity of these molecules to become very volatile and contain the “essence of” the plant’s fragrance. Molecules such as geraniol are found on the leaves of geranium plants, geranial or citral give a strong lemon (citrus) odor, limonene is found in many citrus plants, pinene in pine, thymol in thyme, menthol in mint (actually a terpenoid because it has an oxygen atom, and not a terpene sensu stricto, which have only carbon atoms), humalene in humulus lupulus or hops in Latin, etc. In fact, many students have heard about terpenes because they are synthesized on the trichomes or plant hair of cannabis leaves, and offer various aromas for their use, along with possible medical benefits. Isoprene and many essential oils, being very volatile, are closely involved in production of the air pollutant, ozone. In addition, when they are oxidized by atmospheric ozone, ·OH, or NOx radicals, aerosols may form that cause scattering of the sunlight; since the intensity of the scattering is proportional to \\(1/ \\lambda^4\\), the short wavelengths λ are enhanced in the scattered light, making it look blue (Rayleigh scattering). This is the main explanation for, e.g., the appearance and the name of the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina which hosts many conifer species. Some authors question whether the ‘essential oils’ and many terpenoids belong to the lipid family at all (e.g., W. (bill). W. Christie (n.d.)), but we thought that it was a missed opportunity not to mention them here. 4.5.10.2 Vitamins E and K Finally, isoprenoid side chains are present in quinone based isoprenoids such as vitamin K, needed for blood coagulation (Koagulation in Danish), plastoquinone and ubiquinone involved in the electron transport chains of, respectively, the chloroplasts and mitochondria. The long isoprenoid chains of plasto- and ubiquinone allow these molecules to readily insert within the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane of these organelles. Figure 4.68: Quinone based isoprenoids including vitamin K, needed for blood coagulation (Koagulation in Danish), plastoquinone and ubiquinone involved in the electron transport chains of, respectively, the chloroplasts and mitochondria. The quinone functional group is represented in magenta The ubiquinone can be an electron transport molecule thanks to the quinone moeity, which can accept two electrons and be reduced into ubiquinol (Figure 4.69). It can easily be oxidized back into ubiquinone thanks to the electron resonance of the quinone moeity, and therefore ‘liberate’ its electrons to be ready to transport more electrons during the electron transfer chain. Ubiquinone is often referred to as the coenzyme Q. Figure 4.69: The reduction of ubiquinone (or coenzyme Q) to ubiquinol (QH2). The quinone functional group is represented in magenta Tocol-based isoprenoids like tocopherols and tocotrienols, collectively known as tocochromanols (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.) including molecules such as vitamin E, are essential for animals and humans, which must ingest enough of them for their growth. In plants, they are especially important as antioxidant molecules, limiting the damage from photosynthesis-derived reactive oxygen species during conditions of oxidative stress, including high-intensity light stress (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Figure 4.70: Tocol-based isoprenoids including vitamin E, essential for animals and humans, and acting as important antioxidant molecules In summary: Prenol or isoprenoid lipids comprise a very large number of molecules based on the common isoprene C5 building unit. Molecules with C and H atoms only are called terpenes, the others isoprenoids Isoprenoids have the propensity to be assembled in pairs because geranyl pyrophosphate (two isoprene units) is the molecule upon which most of them are built. As a result, molecules with 4, 6, or 8 isoprene units are called di-, tri-, and tetraterpenes(oids) Isoprenoids have the propensity to form carbon rings, which are among the reasons why they are so aromatic to our olfactory sense. Essential oils, although not always classified as lipids, provide everyday life experience of isoprenoids in the smell of mint, pine, lemon, thyme, lavender, etc. Isoprenoids such as carotene, xanthophyll (tetraterpenoids) play a major role in capturing light energy in photosynthesis, while plasto- and ubiquinone play a major role in the electron transfer chain in the chloroplast and mitochondrion membranes Vitamin A, E, and K are prenol lipids 4.5.11 Sterol lipids 4.5.11.1 Cholesterol and oxysterols The most famous of the sterol lipid is cholesterol as it plays an essential role in the animal cell membrane rigidity as already described in section 4.5.2 above. All sterol lipids are derived from the triterpene squalene (Table 4.2 and 4.71), eventually leading to two slightly different precursors: lanosterol for animals and fungi, and cycloartenol for plants and algae. Because of this distinction, phyto- and zoosterols are a bit different. Sterol and steroid lipids all have fused rings and a planar geometry, which gives them rigidity and strength. As a result, they play an essential role in membrane stability and particularly in lipid rafts where the membrane has less a fluidic property, and more of gel like properties (details in section 4.5.2). Figure 4.71: Synthesis of lanosterol and cycloartenol, the precursors of respectively the zoo- and phytosterols lipids from DiMethylAllyl PyroPhosphate (DMAPP) and its isomer Isopentanyl PyroPhosphate (IPP), geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), to squalene, before it goes into cyclization to form four fused carbon rings Zoo- and phytosterols are consistent within their kingdoms, but in reality extremely close at the molecular scale and in their functions of stabilizing the cell membranes near nano-domains and stabilizing proteins in the membrane as cholesterol may strongly bind to them (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Zoosterols are based upon cholesterol molecule, a C27 molecule, or triterpene that has lost 3 methyl groups. The oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol are called oxysterols and correspond to the partial oxidation of cholesterol (e.g., cerebrosterol in Figure 4.72). Etymology Corner The English word cholesterol, comes from the French cholestérol, itself derived from the word cholesterine proposed by French chemist Michel Engène Chevreul in 1816: “Je nommerai cholesterine, de χολη [choli], bile, et στερεος [stereos], solide, la substance cristallisée des calculs biliares humains, … I will name cholesterine — from χολη (bile) and στερεος (solid) — the crystalized substance from human gallstones …” (Chevreul 1816). François Poulletier de la Salle seems to be the first actual discoverer of cholesterol crystals in 1758 or 1769 although he did not publish his results, which were later quoted by his collaborators. 4.5.11.2 Phytosterols and hopanoids Higher plant sterols are very close to animal cell cholesterol, with the variations on the C24 (additions of methyl or ethyl groups) and double bonds between C22 and C23 (e.g., campesterol in Figure 4.72). Ergosterol, the main sterol in fungi and yeasts, has an additional double bond between C7 and C8 (Figure 4.72). It is remarkable to observe that there is little variation in animal sterols, cholesterol being the dominant form, other than the oxidative derivatives, while there are more than 8 plant sterols identified, with small variations among them. Figure 4.72: Cholesterol is the most common zoosterol. Cerebrosterol is an oxidated derivative of cholesterols in animals. Ergosterol is the equivalent of cholesterol for fungi and yeast. Campesterol is one of the many plant sterols characterized by additional side chains on the C24. All atoms and bonds differing from the animal cell cholesterol are highlighted in red Bacteria and other prokaryotic organisms such as blue-green algae do not in general contain any of the conventional sterols found in plants and animals (there are always exceptions), but rather many species have related molecules, i.e. pentacyclic triterpenoids based on a hopane skeleton with four cyclohexane rings and a cyclopentane E-ring and termed ‘hopanoids’ Perhaps the most abundant hopanoid in living organisms is tetrahydroxybacteriohopane (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Figure 4.73: Tetrahydroxybacteriohopane, the most abundant hopanoid in bacteria and other prokaryotic organisms, has very similar functions to those of sterols in the membranes of animals and plants in that they can intercalate into phospholipid bilayers and modulate the fluidity of membranes by interacting with their complex lipid components 4.5.11.3 Steroid signal molecules Among the most remarkable sterol lipids are the steroid hormones, and particularly the sex hormones and cholecalciferol hormone better known as vitamin D. Estradiol and testoterones have lost the aliphatic chain of the reference cholesterol. Estradiol is a naturally occurring hormone that circulates endogenously within the human body. It is the most potent form of mammalian estrogenic steroids and acts as the major female sex hormone. As such, estradiol plays an essential role in the regulation of the menstrual cycle, in the development of puberty and secondary female sex characteristics, as well as in ageing and several hormonally-mediated disease states. Testosterone is the most important androgen, i.e., the major male sex hormone, in potency and quantity. It is remarkable to see how apparently relatively small differences between the two molecules can make such fundamental differences! Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is a steroid hormone produced in the skin when exposed to ultraviolet light or obtained from dietary sources. The active metabolite of cholecalciferol, calcitriol plays an important role in maintaining blood calcium and phosphorus levels and mineralization of bone. Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism. Figure 4.74: Estradiol and testoterone as the major female and male sex hormones, respectively. All differences in atoms and bonds are highlighted in orange and green. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is a metabolite of cholesterol and necessary for the calcium and phosphate regulation in the human body The transport of sterol lipids through vascular animal organisms is problematic because, despite the hydroxy group of the A carbon ring of cholesterol (Figure 4.72) that make sterol lipids somewhat polar, cholesterol is insoluble in water, very much like all lipids and in particular triglycerides. A specialized type of pseudo-organelles called lipoproteins transports hydrophobic lipids through the body. This organelle is formed by a single layer of phospholipids assembled as a sphere creating a hydrophilic outer surface soluble in water, and a hydrophobic compartment inside in which cholesterol, cholesterol esters and triglycerides are stored. Inserted proteins called apolipoproteins provide structural, communication and enzymatic activities. Figure 4.75: Chylomicron, or the largest of the lipoproteins which serve in transporting lipids in vascular animal organisms. T: Triglycerides; C: Cholesterol; ApoA, ApoB, ApoC, ApoE: lipoproteins By Xvazquez Depending on the size of the sphere, scientists have named these High Density Lipoproteins (HDL; 5-12 nm diameter), Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL; 18-25 nm diameter), Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL; 25-35 nm diameter), Very Low Density Lipoproteins (VLDL; 30-80 nm diameter), and chylomicrons (75-1200 nm diameter) (Feingold and Grunfeld 2018). The HDL and LDL acronyms are rather well known and are common indicators reported in routine blood analyzes. Cholesterol in lipoproteins is often esterified with fatty acids to form sterol esters, making the molecules much less polar than free cholesterol. Interestingly, cholesterol is not metabolized by humans as a source of energy, despite the fact that it stores quite a few electrons. Instead, cholesterol is a precursor of hormones, vitamin D, and its metabolites (e.g., bile acids) serve as surfactant in the digestive system to help digestion and assimilation of nutrients and essential molecules (e.g., amino-acids, monosaccharides, essential fatty acids). In summary: Almost all sterol and steroid lipids have four fused rings and a planar geometry, which gives them rigidity and strength. These properties are essential for their functions in cell membranes They are all derived from the triterpene squalene Zoo- and phytosterols play an essential role in the membrane nanodomains by rendering the membrane in a liquid-ordered phase, i.e., more gel-like and more rigid Sterols tend not to serve as a source of energy in animals, but rather are degraded into metabolites that serve as surfactant in the digestive system to help digestion and assimilation of nutrients and essential molecules (e.g., amino-acids, monosaccharides, essential fatty acids) Animal sterols (with triglycerides) being hydrophobic are carried in the blood in specialized single phospholipid layered vesicles called lipoproteins, the most known of which are HDL and LDL, usually in the form of sterol esters Essential metabolites of cholesterol include sexual hormones and vitamin D 4.5.12 Summary about the isoprene-based lipids Broadly, isoprene-based lipids are all based on isoprene units, which have the capacity to stay as linear chains, or form saturated and unsaturated carbon rings. The cyclization is complete with sterol lipids where mostly four fused rings and a planar geometry are at the basis of the structural strength of many zoo- and phytosterols when inserted in the acyl-based bilayer of membranes. Sterol metabolites such as steroid hormones play a major role in the development of animals. Isoprenoids such as prenol lipids play important role in energy capturing and electron transfer, as well as communication molecules, including vitamins and hormones. This concludes the part on isoprene-based lipids. The next part briefly presents other lipids or biological importance we thought would fit better in their own part. 4.5.13 Other notable lipids 4.5.13.1 Waxes as fatty acid esters There is no satisfactory definition of the word “wax” in chemical terms. It is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word “weax” for beeswax, so a practical definition of a wax may therefore be “a substance similar in composition and physical properties to beeswax”. Biochemists often link waxes with the thin layer of fatty constituents that cover the leaves of plants or provide a surface coating for insects or the skin of animals for which primary requirements are spreadability and chemical and metabolic stability. Such surface waxes are produced by specialized cells or glands, and all tend to contain wax esters as major and perhaps defining components, i.e. esters of long-chain fatty alcohols with long-chain fatty acids. (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). Most waxes are formed by two (fatty acid + fatty alcohol) or three moieties (fatty acid + fatty alkane-di-ol + fatty acid), in which case they are referred to as diester waxes. Waxes form the cuticle of plant leaves, but are also secreted by specialized glands in animals, in which case they tend to be associated with triacylglycerols and/or sterol esters. The uropygial gland of birds produces waxes gives feathers their water tightness. Spermaceti or the substance present in sperm whale and skulls of other dolphin and whales, is made by 75% of cetyl palmitate and 25% of triacylglycerols. The other animal wax of commercial value is wool wax of lanolin having waterproofing properties that aids sheep in shedding water from their coats. Lanolin contains up to 50% wax esters and 33% sterol (lanosterol) esters (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.). 4.5.13.2 Polyketides Polyketides are a large group of secondary metabolites which either contain alternating carbonyl and methylene groups (-CO-CH2-) (Wikipedia contributors 2020a). Many mycotoxins produced by fungi are polyketides or polyketide derivatives and many are commonly used as antimicrobial, antiparasitic, and anticancer agents. Important examples of these drugs include erythromycins, tetracylines, nystatins, avermectins, and antitumor epothilones (Fahy et al. 2005). Fahy et al. (2005) classify them as lipids while others (e.g., W. (bill). W. Christie (n.d.)) do not. 4.5.13.3 Natural cyclic fatty acid based lipids Branched-chain fatty acids are common in bacterial and archaeal membranes where their concentration often exceeds that of linear-chain fatty acids. The variations in the presence, nature, and number of branching groups in fatty acids lead to distinct physicochemical properties of the lipids that in turn result in biological membranes with unique structural and functional properties (Poger and Mark 2015b). Some bacteria and Archea have peculiar fatty acids chains that include cyclic The physiological rationale for cyclopropane ring formation in bacterial membranes remains obscure. There are many other lipids that have been described in detail (e.g., Fahy et al. (2005); W. (bill). W. Christie (n.d.)), but we decided that they would not aid to synthesize what lipids are. In summary: “Lipids are fatty acids and their derivatives, and substances related biosynthetically or functionally to these compounds” (W. (bill). W. Christie, n.d.) Long aliphatic chains may store many electrons, thus making lipids energy storage molecules Fatty acyl chains open the possibility for amphipatic properties with hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads, which allows for the formation of very tight membranes and compartmentalization of the cell in organelles Phosphates play an essential role in the structure of acyl-based membrane lipids and on the polar nature of the heads (along with moeities containing nitrogen) The methylated and unsaturated aliphatic chains (e.g., isoprenoids), tend to form carbon rings, yielding lipids such as sterols which are small, yet strong enough to rigidify cell membranes 4.6 Phenolics and polyphenols This chapter is still under construction Contrary to the previous carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, all considered to be primary metabolites, i.e., directly involved in normal growth, development, and reproduction of cells and organisms, phenolics and polyphenols are considered as secondary metabolites, i.e., not directly involved in these processes, but recognized to have an important ecological function. For this reason they rarely appear in textbooks introducing the biochemistry of life. We have decided to remedy this error by specifically crafting a section dedicated to these molecules so important to ecological engineering. 4.6.1 The impermeable world of phenolics With the phenolics, lie the “tastes and the colors of the world” (Sélosse 2019). The complexity of these secondary metabolites does not only come from their assemblages in di-, and polymers, but also from the extraordinary diversity of what one might call the phenolic monomers…! If you thought lipids were complicated and diverse, phenolics are not any simpler. Thanks to lignins, nearly 40% of the carbon atoms stored in the phytosphere belong to phenolics or polyphenol molecules! This group is thus anything but insignificant…! Yet, in ecological engineering, we have not fully taken the measure of how important these molecules truly are, and, until now, we have mostly ignored them although they may very well be “the elephant in the room”… To our defense, there are reasons for this as we shall see. So, what are phenolics and why do they matter? Figure 4.76: Polyphenols are highly represented in fruits and vegetables and make for their great diversity of colors and tastes (figure obtained from Stéphane Quideau et al. 2011) Phenolics are sometimes loosely referred to as tannins (Sélosse 2019). Phenolics include molecules that have an aroma to our nose, that feel astringent in our mouths, that generate for a good part the colors of flowers or of tree leaves in autumn, or that play a fundamental structural role for plants (e.g., lignins) to erect themselves in a very low density aerial milieu (i.e., the air). Phenolics have antibiotic properties, protect many plants from insects, and define to a large extent the quality of organic matter and the rate at which its energy can be released in soil and in sediment. This is why their role is crucial in ecological engineering and deserves all our attention. Additionally, phenolics and polyphenols have also received quite a bit of attention from the general public for the last 30 years as they have been found to provide human health benefits. As is often the case in science, there is a battle for the naming of a molecular group and which molecules should belong, or not… Sélosse, in his fantastic book written for the general public (Sélosse 2019), solves the problem by calling them tannins. This helps connect them with everyday life experience as many phenolics are indeed true tannins. In English, the word phenolics seems to be rather efficient to put into one term a large variety of molecules, although the general public cannot directly relate to them… In short, all these phenolic molecules have one or more aromatic rings with one or more hydroxy groups. The basis is thus the phenol molecule, i.e., an aromatic ring of which at least one carbon has been oxidized such that its hydrogen has been replaced by one hydroxy -OH group (Figure 4.77; also described is the section on aromatic hydrocarbons). Figure 4.77: Skeletal formula (left), Lewis dot structure (center), and 3D space-filling animated view of phenol (right, grey = C atom, red = oxygen atome, white = hydrogen atom) showing the hydroxy group on one of the carbons of the benzene or aromatic ring However, not all organic molecules that have phenols or phenyl groups belong to the phenolics group…! Think about the phenylalanine amino acid for example. Things would have been too simple otherwise. Everybody agrees that phenolics only contain CHO atoms, no N,S, or P (well almost…). The most abundant, other than lignins, are called the polyphenols, and have captured much of the scientific attention and beyond. Thanks to the antioxidant properties of many of them, the term polyphenols has also been used to describe molecules that only have one phenol moiety… This has caused quite a bit of confusion. Hardcore chemists have had their own discussion on what constitute phenolics and/or polyphenols and discussions are on-going (e.g., https://www.groupepolyphenols.com/). Below are some exerts from experts in the domain that illustrate the struggle of defining phenolics and polyphenols. The term “polyphenol” should be used to define compounds exclusively derived from the shikimate/phenylpropanoid and/or the polyketide pathway, featuring more than one phenolic unit and deprived of nitrogen-based functions. This definition lets out all monophenolic structures, as well as all their naturally occurring derivatives such as phenyl esters, methyl phenyl ethers and O-phenyl glycosides. However, investigations on these compounds, which are often the biogenetic precursors of “true” polyphenols, definitely have their place in polyphenol research, but qualifying them as polyphenols is pushing it too far (S. Quideau, n.d.). The inclusion of monophenolic compounds in polyphenol-oriented research can perhaps find its justification through an important property that all phenols share to some extent, and that is their capability to scavenge oxidatively-generated free radicals such as those derived from lipids and nucleic acids. This antioxidant activity of phenols is frequently cited to be the main event responsible for the prevention of age-related diseases such as neurodegeneration, carcinogenesis and cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, by phenol/polyphenol-rich diets. (S. Quideau, n.d.) Thus, as a general rule recently proposed by Quideau et al. (2011), the terms ‘plant phenolics’ should be strictly used to refer to secondary natural metabolites arising biogenetically from either the shikimate/phenylpropanoid pathway, which directly provides phenylpropanoids, or the ’polyketide’acetate/malonate pathway, and which fulfill a very broad range of physiological roles in plants (Lattanzio 2013). Has this clarified what phenolics are or are not…? Probably not so much, and this would be hardly surprising as the shikimate/phenylpropanoid and the ‘polyketide’ acetate/malonate pathways are not metabolic pathways everybody can relate to, right…? The world of phenolics is a bit impermeable to new comers, one has to admit! As a naturalist, classifications that relate moieties and molecules together are appealing to me and I will use the schemes proposed by Lattanzio, and Tsimogiannis and Oreopoulou to describe in hopefully enough details what phenolics are (Lattanzio 2013; Tsimogiannis and Oreopoulou 2019): Phenolics can be classified into monomeric, dimeric, oligomers from condensation of different monomers, and polymeric phenols (Figure 4.78): Among the monomeric phenols, one can distinguish three classes: a single benzene ring (C6 class) a C6 ring with an attached carbon chain containing one to four or seven carbon atoms (C6-Cn class, n=1 to 4, 7) a more complex skeleton in which the carbon chain is further attached to a second benzene ring (C6-Cn-C6 class, n=1,2,3,7). The C6-C3-C6 category has historically been particularly studied Many of the monomeric phenols serve as monomers for polymeric phenols, among which one can distinguish: phenolic dimers [(C6-C1)2, (C6-C3)2, (C6-C2-C6)2, (C6-C3-C6)2] oligomeric products derived from condensation reactions (not represented in Figure 4.78) the polymers with general formulas [(C6)n, (C6-C1)n, (C6-C3)n, and (C6-C3-C6)n] Figure 4.78: Attempt to represent the different classes of phenolic compounds existing in nature with some examples illustrated. Phenolics resulting from the condensation of separate monomers are not represented in the figure to simplify the classification At the undergraduate level, one should be able to recognize moieties in molecules and be aware of the major phenolics molecules. At the graduate level, one should realize that to understand nature and put things together, having these molecules as part of the basic vocabulary and knowledge will undeniably broaden your knowledge and open the doors of multidisciplinarity. 4.6.2 Unavailable energy onto phenolic molecules Let us now count the energy packed onto phenolics, i.e., the number of electrons stored on the carbon atoms. The Lewis dot structure (Figure 4.77) suggests that 28 electrons are stored onto the phenol molecule (blue electrons allocated to carbon atoms). This corresponds to an average of 4.67 electrons per carbon atom, that is 10% more than carbohydrates store on average. Gallic acid, which has three hydroxy and a carboxyl groups attached to the aromatic ring (Figure 4.84) stores 24 electrons for 7 carbon atoms, for an average of 3.42 electrons per carbon atom, or about 10% less than carbohydrates. In other words, the potential energy stored onto phenolics is very comparable to that of carbohydrates, the go to molecules for energy release in cells. This suggests that it takes energy to metabolize these molecules, and that it theoretically is beneficial for microbes to have phenolics as a source of energy. Well, that is without counting on the extraordinary stability of the aromatic rings associated with the delocalized conjugated π bonds (section 3.1.3). For this reason, there is no equivalence to the reducing sugars, which can release their energy by opening their ring shape, in the world of phenolics. Despite the energy stored onto the carbon atoms of phenolics, the carbons of the aromatic rings do not get easily oxidized, or only partially by losing a hydrogen atom to oxygen. This, however, does not undermine the strength and stability of the aromatic ring which stays as a ring. Incidentally, the hydroxys of phenolics tend to easily form hydrogen bonds, particularly with water, while the planar aromatic ring tends to be more hydrophobic. This results in their ability to form complexes with proteins in particular. Let us now explore what phenolics molecules look like. Well, in reality, this will only be a glimpse of the extraordinary variety of these fascinating compounds. 4.6.3 Monomeric phenols 4.6.3.1 C6 phenols Monomeric phenols and phenolic acids are not naturally abundant as separate molecules. However, many of them end up as moieties of more complex phenolic molecules. We decided to present several of them in more details. Before we do that, and to ease the description of phenolics, some nomenclature is useful. As stated before, nucleophilic and electrophilic additions do not occur on aromatic rings, only substitutions of H for other functional groups. But the substitution do not occur randomly. They either occur on an ortho, meta, or para locations on the aromatic ring, compared to the reference substituent (X in Figure 4.79). In reality, for what we are concerned, the reasons why subtitutions occur in either of these positions is beyond our scope and interest. However, through this section, ortho, meta, and para are sometimes used to more precisely describe molecules. Figure 4.79: Left: Examples of monomeric phenols in C6 differing from the number and placement of the hydroxy groups on the benzene ring (non-exhaustive list). Right: illustration of the ortho, meta, or para substitution locations on aromatic rings, where X represents any radical or carbon chain Catechol Catechol (1,2-Benzenediol; Figure 4.79 and 4.80) can be found in small quantities in fruits and vegetables. Its name comes from the southeast Asian acacia tree Senegalia catechu called kachu in Malay. From this tree, the catechu (latinized version of kachu), sometimes called cachou is extracted for pharmaceutical, tanning and coloring purposes. You have seen its oxidation into a reddish-brown melanoid pigment when you cut an apple or a potatoe and you leave them exposed to oxygen of the atmosphere. It is actually your cutting that allows mixing of catechol with the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) naturally present in the chloroplasts of apples, which allows the oxidation of catechol (into 1,2 benzoquinones or ortho-benzoquinones; see difference with 1,4 benzoquinone in Figure 4.79), only in the presence of oxygen though. Benzoquinones can polymerize together or bind with amino acids to form the brown color you recognize right away. This also corresponds to the phenomenon when fruits or vegetables are bruised or indented, and the process is generally referred to as enzymatic browning (Figure 4.80). Figure 4.80: Enzymatic browning due to the oxidation of catechol into ortho-benzoquinone, reacting with itself or with amino acids to form the familiar brown color on apples or potatoes freshly cut and left in contact with oxygen This everyday life observation is actually of utmost importance for ecological engineering: many extra-cellular enzymes exuded by microbes to catabolize organic matter for their respiration are stimulated or reversely inhibited by the presence or absence of oxygen. In fact, we shall see later that it is the phenol oxidase enzymes and the presence of oxygen that control much of the mineralization of organic matter in ecologically engineered treatment systems. You have certainly heard about catecholamines, which serve as neurotransmitters, one of which is dopamine, or the ‘pleasure molecule’, the one your brain releases upon watching screens… Dopamine has an ethylamine group attached to a catechol moiety. Urushiols, the oil developed by the poison ivy and poison oak present on the American continent has a catechol moiety to which long aliphatic unsaturated chains are attached. The catechol moiety is at the basis of many more complex phenolics. So it is for resorcinol, the second isomer of catechol (Benzene-1,3-diol, Figure 4.79), which does not really exist in nature as a separate entity, although it is widely used for the industrial production of phenol formaldehyde resins such as Bakelite. Hydroquinone and Benzoquinone The third Benzenediol is hydroquinone. Quinone comes for quin(a) the Spanish writing of the Quechua word kina (which mean trunc or more likely bark) + -one for the two ketone functional group. In hydroquinone, the prefix hydro-, stands for hydrogen, and hydroquinone is a benzoquinone that has gained hydrogens and electrons, and it is the reduced compound of benzoquinone (Figure 4.81). Figure 4.81: Oxidation of hydroquinone to para-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone, with intermediates, including the supereactive semiquinone radical On a side note that is quite fascinating, nonetheless, the bombardier beetle has the ability to spew para-benzoquinone and methyl para-benzoquinone to defend itself from predators. Their defensive apparatus consists of two compartments known as the reservoir and the reaction chamber. When challenged, muscles surrounding the reservoir containing 1,4-hydroquinone and 2-methyl-1,4-hydroquinone (Figure 4.82 left) contract sending these into the reaction chamber where they mix with enzymes and hydrogen peroxides. The highly exothermic oxidation upon mixing generates so much heat that temperatures reach 100°C vaporizing water, resulting, many times per second, in an explosive discharge of a hot noxious chemical spray containing two major quinones: 1,4-benzoquinone and 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone [Figure 4.82 left; Attygalle et al. (2020)] Figure 4.82: Biosynthetic formation of hydroquinone resulting, when mixed with H2O2 in a reaction chamber, in the production of noxious gas mist (left), or high pressure directed jet stream of para-benzoquinone for the rightfully called bombardier beetle (right) (after (Attygalle et al. 2020) and (Eisner and Aneshansley 1999)) Phloroglucinol From the Greek Phló(os) (φλοιός, which means bark, tree bark, fruit skin) + r(hiza) (ῥίζα, which means root) + o + glukús (γλυκύς, which means sweet) + suffix -ol because of all the hydroxy/alcohol groups. Phloroglucinol (Figure 4.79) moiety is commonly found in the ring A of flavonoids (see below). It also corresponds to the monomer of phlorotanins found in marine brown algae. You might have already encountered phloroglucinol as it is commonly used as a spasmolytic agent to treat colic, as well as spastic pain of the digestive and biliary tracts. Pyrogallol Pyrogallol (Figure 4.79) is a monophenol compound with 3 hydroxy groups, two of which placed in ortho on either side of the central one. It is a toxic compound by itself. The prefix Pyro- in pyrogallol signifies ‘pure’, and the suffix -ol gives an indication that there are alcohol groups, in fact three. In reality, pyrogallol corresponds to the C6 part of the lot more common gallic acid, which is a C6-C1 monomeric phenol. The latter is found in galls, common on many trees and shrubs including oak (Quercus), mapple (Acer), or dog rose (Rosa canina; Figure 4.85). Guaiacol Anisol, from which the anis aroma comes and not illustrated in this section, is a phenol which hydroxy group has been replaced by a methoxy one. Guaiacol is a bit of a mix between phenol and anisol: a methoxy group has been substituted on the ortho position (Carbon next to the -OH of phenol; Figure 4.79 and 4.83). Guaiacol was named by Unverdorben after it was found after distillation of the Guaiacum tree resin or wood creosote (Unverdorben 1829). Guaiacum trees are native to subtropical and tropical regions of the Americas and the prefix guaiac- comes from the Taíno language originally spoken in the Bahamas. The wood of guaiacum trees has among the highest density in the world (1.3) and therefore sinks in water. Guaiacol and its derivatives have widespread presence in flora and fauna and are used as aroma components in the food and perfume industry and as local anesthetics and antiseptics in medicine. Guaiacol is responsible for the flavor of smoke in smoked and roasted foods such as bacon, fish, and coffee. Guaiacol and its diverse derivatives are well-known for their smoky, ham, vanilla-like, clove-like, medicinal odors [Figure 4.83; reviewed by Ghadiriasli et al. (2019)]. Figure 4.83: Guaiacol and alkyl, alkenyl, and halogenated derivatives have ham, vanilla-like, clove-like, medicinal, or smoky odors. (after Ghadiriasli et al. 2019) 4.6.3.2 C6-C1 phenolics: benzoic acid and benzaldehyde derivatives Their basic skeletons are benzoic acid or benzaldehydes (Figure 4.84) and they differ by the number and location of the hydroxy- and methoxy-substitution on the aromatic ring. Notice the appearance of the methoxy group (-O-CH3) on the benzene rings (it already appeared in guaiacol; Figure 4.83). This observation gives a chance to review some of the diversity among the C6 and C6-C1 monomeric phenols. Much of the diversity among them is associated with the nature, number, and placement of the substituents, none of which occurs by accident. For the C6 phenols, the nature of the substituents can either be -OH (hydroxy) or -OCH3 (methoxy). The same applies for the C6-C1 monomeric phenols, although additional diversity comes with the group forming the C1, which usually comes as a carboxyl (-COOH), an aldehyde (-CHO), or much less often as a methyl (-CH3). And so what? Well, to better understand how phenolics work, it is important to realize that the Cn (n = 1 to 3, 7) aliphatic chain substituents generally tend to withdraw electrons from the aromatic ring when they have double bonds associated with an oxygen atom. Reversely, substituents like -OH and -OCH3 tend to donate electrons to the aromatic ring thanks to the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atom bonded to the ring, creating a resonnance effect (see more details below). Again, the Cn chains tend to withdraw electrons and are referred to as electron withdrawing groups - EWG while the hydroxy and methoxy groups are referred to as electron donating groups - EDG. For all the details on how this works, you may read section 17.5.1 in the glossary. All in all, phenolics are generally built such that the effect of the EWG and EDG neutralize each other to a large extent. The placement of the -OH and -OCH3 on ortho, meta, para positions (Figure 4.79) has further implication on how the π electrons are delocalized, although this is still the topic of active research. The consequences for us are that light may be absorbed differently yielding variable optical properties among phenolics (e.g., flower pigments, light absorbance of water) and of organic matter in general. In ecological engineering and in environmental sciences in general, this is the basis of why we measure absorbance of light in water as it can give quantitative and qualitative information on dissolved organic matter. Figure 4.84: Examples of monomeric phenols in C6-C1 configurations differing from the number and placement of hydroxy and methoxy groups on the benzene ring (non-exhaustive list) Salicylic acid: Of note is salicylic acid, not quite as famous as acetyl salicylic or commonly called aspirin, where an acetyl group (-OOC-CH3) makes an ester bond with the hydroxy group on the benzene ring. The word salicylic comes from the Latin Salix, name of the willow tree, in the bark of which this acid was first discovered. Salicylic acid is also found in Filipendula ulmaria (meadowsweet in English, a common perennial herbaceous plant of Europe and Western Asia) also named Spirea ulmaria, and from which the word aspirin is derived with the prefix a- standing for acetyl. Vanillin: Vanillin, the primary component of the extract of the vanilla bean, is the benzaldehyde version of vanillic acid and counts among the most used benzaldehydes. Gallic acid Gallic acid (Figure 4.84), with pyrogallol (Figure 4.79), is a toxic compound. Gallic acid is the central moiety of ellagitannins and gallotannins (details below), which are particularly concentrated in plant galls, hence their names. Galls are common on many trees and bushes such as oaks (Quercus sp.), rosebush or dog rose (Rosa canina), or maples (Acer sp.) (Figure 4.85). These are reactions of the plants to the biting of specialized hymenoptera insects of the Cynipidae family, in which they lay their eggs. The latter is found in galls, common on many trees and shrubs including oak (Quercus), mapple (Acer), or dog rose (Rosa canina; Figure 4.85). Galls were commonly used to tan leather. This tanning ability of tannins is described in more details later. Figure 4.85: Galls are commonly found on oak (A, B, D, E), mapple (C), or dog rose (F). They are reactions for these plants to small hymenoptera insects that use them for the development of their larvae. Galls were widely used for their tanning ability as up to 70% of their dry weight is made of gallo-tannins Syringic acid: Syringic acid is present in many fruits, including olives, dates, pumpkins, the acai palm, honey and certain spices. It is found in higher concentrations in blue berries such as blueberries or red grapes, and therefore in red wine. It is notably formed by the decomposition of oenin, an anthocyanin that dyes the grapes and red wine. It is also present in vinegar (Wikipedia contributors, n.d.a). Its name comes from Syringa, the latin name of the common Lilac, as it derives from the syringine glucoside first found in bark of the common lilac. Protocatechuic acid: Protocatechuic acid (PCA) is antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and is a major metabolite of antioxidant polyphenols found in green tea. It is also one of the main metabolites of complex polyphenols, such as anthocyanins and proanthocyanins. Protocatechuic acid may act as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antitumor, antibacterial, antidiabetic, and antiapoptotic agents (Song et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2021). 4.6.3.3 C6-C2 phenolics: Phenylethanoids and derivatives Three main groups of phenylethanoids have been identified: phenylethanoic acids, acetophenones, and phenylethyl alcohol derivatives. Figure 4.86 illustrates the basic skeletons of these phenylethanoids. Actual molecules differ from additions of hydroxy groups (-OH) and methoxy groups (-OCH3) on the benzene ring, on carbons 3, 4, or on both. The carbon on which the Cn group is linked is referred to as carbon number 1 (Figure 4.86). Phenylacetic acid has a honey-like odor and serves as a plant hormone in fruits. Acetophenones are found in many foods including apple, cheese, apricot, banana, beef, and cauliflower (Wikipedia contributors 2021b). Tyrosol and hydrotyrosol are phenylethyl alcohols with hydroxy groups, respectively, on carbon 4 and carbons 3 &amp; 4. They are found in olive oil and have been shown to have potent antioxydant capabilities. Hydroxytyrosol is involved in many other molecules such as the oleuropein, the molecule that gives bitterness to raw olives and that must be removed for olives to become edible. Figure 4.86: Basic skeletons of monomeric C6-C2 phenols referred to as phenylethanoids. These are often associated with fragrance of fruits and vegetables and have antioxydant properties 4.6.3.4 Conjugated bonds as a basic structural pattern Time to pause. Let us be frank, the litany of phenolics types and names can become quickly overwhelming, unless you are a hardcore biochemist (but you would not be reading this book) or a naturalist with an unquenchable desire to discover nature’s diversity. In reality, among this incredible diversity of phenolics molecules, and we have only started this exploration, one has to wonder why these molecules are arranged the way they are, and what are the common themes behind this diversity. We have already addressed the part that concerns the nature, number and location of the substituents earlier. But as the size of these molecules increases, several questions arise: why are these molecules so stable in their structure, why do they have anti-oxidant properties (and what does it mean?), and why do they have pesticide properties? The basic and simple answer to these questions is: conjugated double bonds create very stable electronic resonance that explain a lot of their properties. Recall that resonance describes the delocalization of electrons within molecules and the more resonance structures the more stable molecules tend to be. In the section introducing aromatic and phenyl functional groups, we saw that one of the reasons for the stability of the benzene ring was what we refer to as conjugated double bonds. What does this mean again? It means that, for example in a C7 aliphatic chain (Figure 4.87), there would be 3 double bonds alternating with 3 simple bonds between the carbon atoms. Their respective locations are illustrated in the top of Figure 4.87 and both can co-exist. These are called resonance structures as they both describe the possible locations of the electrons. The same thing is true for the benzene ring (middle equation of Figure 4.87, left and middle structures), where the location of the double bonds can theoretically alternate. Experimental measurements of the C-C bond lengths in benzene suggests, however, that they are all the same, which would not be the case for stable single and double bonds. So in reality, the π electrons of the double bonds of benzene are delocalized among all carbon atoms. Molecular orbital theory also suggests that the electrons are delocalized onto all atoms of carbon in benzene. Figure 4.87: Illustration of conjugated double bonds in a hypothetical C7 aliphatic chain (top; hepta-2,4,6-triene and hepta-1,3,5-triene): double and single bonds alternate, and their exact respective location suggests that both forms co-exist. The same thing is true for the benzene ring (bottom) where the location of the double bonds can be in the form to the left or middle. Molecular orbital theory suggests that in reality the electrons are delocolized onto all atoms of conjugated bonds (bottom right): this is called resonance Because, either resonance structures of benzene do not represent where the electrons are located, aromatic rings are often represented with a dotted (sometimes solid) circle in the middle of the C6 cyclic chain representing the 6 π delocalized electrons and this representation is referred to as the resonance hybrid structure (right structure of the middle equation in Figure 4.87). The electronic delocalization lowers the electron energy level and is called resonance stabilization. This makes for exceptional thermodynamic and chemical stability of the benzene rings, and of phenolics in general. The bottom equation of Figure 4.87 illustrates the five resonance structures of phenol. While there is free rotation around σ bonds, the combined σ and π double bond is rigid and prevents rotation of aliphatic chains around the double bond. As a result, molecules with conjugated double bonds, such as for the C7 triene, benzene, or phenol in Figure 4.87 are all planar. In fact, this is both a prerequisite and a consequence for resonance to occur. Actually, this property has some major impacts on phenolics stability and instability, and their reactivity with the environment. In summary, the conjugated double bonds allow for resonance stabilization of the phenolics molecules the resonance stabilization of the aromatic rings is exceptional among alkenes Double bonds tend to be rather fragile and break because the π electrons are more loosely attached to the atoms. In the case of phenolics, the aromatic rings do not break but rather undergo substitution reactions. In other words, the hydrogens on the C6 ring get substituted by hydroxy or methoxy groups (more rarely by other groups such as methyl), and the aromatic ring retains its resonance stability. This is the core of C6 phenols. But we already know that phenolics molecules have hydrocarbon chains attached to the aromatic rings (Figure 4.78). The secret to the structure and function of phenolics is maintaining conjugated double bonds and electronic resonance in their basic structure, even with the addition of carbon and oxygen atoms. Figure 4.88 summarizes how conjugated double bonds are the common theme and rule among phenolics Figure 4.88: The secret to the structure and function of phenolics: maintaining conjugated double bonds and electronic resonance among atoms of C6, C6-Cn, and C6-Cn-C6 monomeric phenols. All double bonds have been illustrated in red, as well as the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen atoms, which participate in the electronic resonance of the phenolics compounds. For clarity purposes, only the phenolic skeleton have been illustrated. (B-Benzene; P-Phenol; Q-Quinone; BD-Benzaldehyde; AP-AcetoPhenone; BA-Benzoic Acid; CA-Coumaric Acid; CD-Coumaric Aldehyde; CO-Coumarin; IC-Iso-Coumarin; ML-MonoLignol; CH-Chromone; NP-Naphtalene; NQ-Naphtoquinone; AQ-Anthraquinone; SB-Stilbene; AU-Aurones; FL-Flavonoid; CC-Chalcone) Just imagine, one is given the task to build from the benzene ring complex molecules that would maintain resonance even with the addition of carbon and oxygen atoms. Well, all the C6 molecules (Figure 4.79) varying by the differences in the type and number of substituents would work. The quinone molecule where the double bonds of the carbonyl groups at opposite ends of the aromatic ring would also provide conjugated double bonds (Q in Figure 4.88) Now, let us try to expand the phenolics molecule with one or two carbon atoms while still maintaining the conjugated bonds. The thing one could do is add an aldehyde (-CHO) to form benzaldehydes (BD in Figure 4.88), or a carboxyl group (-COOH) to form benzoic acids (BA in Figure 4.88). Adding an acetyl to form an acetophenone (AP in Figure 4.88) would also work. In all cases, the double bond of the carbonyl group (-C=O) can enter in resonance with the electrons of the aromatic ring, which suggests that the final molecules would be planar. Experience shows that in fact this is the case, although the space taken by the aldehyde, carboxyl, and acetyl groups would suggest otherwise, with functional groups at an angle with the aromatic ring (reviewed by Badhani, Sharma, and Kakkar 2015). An addition of an ethene group would also work, but there are no report in the literature that mention these, possibly because the double bond at the end of an aliphatic chain is fragile and susceptible to breaking. Next comes the addition of three carbon atoms. The obvious solution for that is to add a propene tail, where there would be a double bond that would be conjugated with the ones on the aromatic ring. And indeed, such propene tails exist in nature and are referred to as propanoids, i.e., pseudopropanes. Having the propanoid end carbon be part of an aldehyde (-CHO) or a carboxyl group (-COOH), adds a double bond and provides further stability to the C6-C3 molecules. And indeed, among the C6-C3 molecules, we shall see that there are coumaric aldehydes (CD in Figure 4.88) and coumaric acids (CA in Figure 4.88). An alcohol group at the end of the propanoid chain does not provide a full π electron resonance, but one of the lone pairs of electrons on the alcohol group at the end of the chain can participate to some extent to resonance. Monolignols (ML in Figure 4.88), the monomers of lignins, are built according to this scheme. Now, if one were to bend the propanoid tail of coumaric acid, such that the alcohol group would bend toward the aromatic ring, then after condensation (and removal of two hydrogen atoms), a second ring could form. Coumarin molecules (CO in Figure 4.88) are built on this scheme. Actually, in this configuration, double bonds are not entirely conjugated because of the oxygen atom closing the ring. However, one of the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom that closes the second ring can participate to some extent to the resonance of the molecule, creating a pseudo-resonance inside the molecule. Isocoumarins and chromones (IC and CH in Figure 4.88) are isomers of coumarins and have the same pseudo-resonance pattern. What about adding four carbon atoms? The easiest answer is to add a second fully aromatic ring resulting in naphtalene (NP in Figure 4.88). The two double bonds added are conjugated with the orginal aromatic ring. A quinone ring with double bonds provide a total of three double conjugated double bonds resulting in napthtoquinones (NQ in Figure 4.88), which are very potent phenolic pesticides. Apparently, the addition of 5 to 7 carbon is unstable as the next way to add conjugated double bond chosen by nature, is to add another aromatic ring with some intermediate structure where resonance would be maintained. The solutions nature has kept are anthroquinone where two aromatic ring are fused with a quinone structure (AQ in Figure 4.88) and by a propene chain such as in stilbenes (SB in Figure 4.88). Finally, one could add yet another carbon (9 in addition to the initial benzene ring), one solution nature has found to keep at least a pseudoresonance is to add an entire aromatic ring to a chromone molecule (FL in Figure 4.88), and this corresponds to the flavonoids, the most studied and numerous group of polyphenols. Another solution is to leave the middle ring open: chalcones are built upon this scheme. In summary, the basic structure of monomeric phenolics is very logical as it involves conjugated double bonds to allow electronic resonance, although sometimes only a pseudoresonance is reached. In reality, although the principles of conjugated double bonds and electronic resonance are the rules or the common theme among the structures of phenolics, there are lots of exceptions and variations around that theme. Given this grid of analysis, we can resume our discovery of the next group of monomeric phenols: the phenylpropanoids or the C6-C3 molecules. 4.6.3.5 C6-C3 phenolics: Phenylpropanoids and derivatives With three carbon chains substituted on the aromatic phenol ring, the number of possible molecules increases considerably. It would be futile to describe them all here. The general rule for resonance described above generally holds, but has quite a few exceptions as well. We chose cinnamic acid as the basic model of a generic phenylpropanoid (Figure 4.89). The suffix-oid stands for pseudo, so in the word propanoid, this suggests that the basic propane skeleton has undergone modifications. And to simplify everything, the term propanoid is used and refers to all the C3 chains that are modified. In fact, in cinnamic acid (Figure 4.89), the propanoid tail is a propenoic acid, the simplest unsaturated caboxylic acid. Notice that in the term phenylpropanoids, the aromatic ring appears as a group attached to the propanoid chain. This is just a naming convention that does not have chemical meaning though. Phenylpropanoids occur universally in plants and are also the precursors of many other classes of plant phenolics, including flavonoids, stilbenoids, and xanthones (Lattanzio 2013). Cinnamic acid: As its name indicates, cinnamic acid is especially found in cinnamon oil and Storax eugenol, isoeugenol Figure 4.89: Basic skeletons of monomeric C6-C3 phenols referred to as phenylpropanoids 4.6.3.5.1 Anthraquinones Among the anthraquinones, it is fascinating to see the importance of two of them in history! Alizarin and purpurin are two anthraquinones that are extracted from the madder plant (Rubia tinctorum L.) originating from the middle east (Figure 4.90). The word Alizarin is derived from the French Alizarine, itself derived from the Greek αλιζάρι (alizári, “madder”), itself derived from Ottoman Turkish آلاجهری name of the plant. The word purpurin exists in English and a synonymous is crimson. Well, the madder plant root (garance in French, from the old French warance meaning scarlet) can be ground to extract the scarlet pigments that they contain, i.e., alizarin and purpurin. This was known since the Antiquity in the middle east and Egypt (the Egyptian flag still has the alizarin red in it). But is was not until the mid 1700s that a Persian-born Armenian named Hovhannès Althounian (later naturalized as Jean Althen) brought it to France from where its pigment industry would blossom. He was made a slave by the Ottoman Turks after the latter massacred his entire family, and worked in the madder and cotton plantations for 15 years until he escaped with some precious madder seeds. By the 1820s, madder plantations were all over southern France and the root extract called garancine was used all over the world to dye fabric in red. The color of the fabric was so vivid and appreciated that even the French and British armies use the red uniform throughout the 1800s (Figure 4.90)! This might also have had to do with better vision among the smoke produced by black powder guns of the time. Purpurin, the oxydated version of alizarin was found not to be as stable as a dye though. Figure 4.90: The red alizarin and purpurin anthraquinones have been extracted from the madder plant roots (Rubia tinctorum L.) since Antiquity and used worldwide to dye fabric in red since the 1820s. The French soldier uniform pants were dyed in ‘madder red’ (‘rouge garance’ in French) for nearly a century until world war I. The fifer player (Le joueur de fifre in French) is a famous painting from Édouard Manet that shows well red rendered by alizarin In 1869, alizarin became the first natural pigment to be produced synthetically. German chemists Carl Graebe and Carl Liebermann, employees at BASF, found a way to obtain it from anthracene. A day later, the English chemist William Henry Perkin discovered the same synthesis, independently of the German team. The BASF group filed the patent one day before Perkin and started marketing alizarin in 1871 (Wikipedia contributors, n.d.b). The consequences were that all the madder plantations went out of business within the next ten years. The French army decided to continue support madder growers and its industry for years after that, and this is how the French soldiers appeared against the Prussians in the 1870 Franco-Prussian war. The garance trousers became the symbol of a defeat, but also of the revenge. So much so that while all other armies had changed their uniform for more discrete colors at the turn of the century, the French army soldiers showed up in red trousers and were great targets for the Germans at the onset of the first world war in 1914…! All that because of this alizarin anthraquinone! Phlorotannins are polymers of 2 to 6 phloroglucinol units (Amsler and Fairhead 2005) attached via ether and covalent bonds (Figure 4.91). Phlorotannins provide protection against the UV light, appear to have antiherbovory effects, in part because of detrimental effects on herbivore digestion as phlorotannins form complexes with digestive proteins and other macromolecules, and probably have antifouling effect although this is disputed (Amsler and Fairhead 2005; Hurd et al. 2014). Figure 4.91: Phlorofucofuroeckol (left) and Tetraphlorethol (right) are polymers of respectively 5 and 4 phloroglucinol monomers bonded together by ether and covalent bonds. These are only two among 150 phlorotannins listed which provide UV protection and tend to deter herbivores (grey = C atom, red = oxygen atome, white = hydrogen atom) 4.6.4 Lignins Lignin (from the latin lignum, meaning wood) is, after cellulose, the second most abundant terrestrial biopolymer, accounting for approximately 30% of the organic carbon in the biosphere. The ability to synthesize lignin has been essential in the evolutionary adaptation of plants from an aquatic environment to land. Lignin is crucial for structural integrity of the cell wall and stiffness and strength of the stem. In addition, lignin waterproofs the cell wall, enabling transport of water and solutes through the vascular system, and plays a role in protecting plants against pathogens (Boerjan, Ralph, and Baucher 2003). It is thought that it is the multiple aromatic rings of the phenylpropanoids that provide the stiffness of lignin, hence of wood. Figure 4.92: Three common monolignols, monomers for the lignin molecules: paracoumaryl alcohol (1), coniferyl alcohol (2) and sinapyl alcohol (3) By Yikrazuul - Own work, Public Domain Lignins are polymers of a lot more complex monomers than the monosaccharides presented earlier. The monomers of lignin are called monolignols. Nothing to be scared of, because there is no expectation for the reader to know them! Technically, the lignin monomers are generally referred to as phenylpropanoids (which means that there is a phenol radical attached to a propane like C3 structure). The suffix -oid means pseudo), and technically derived from hydroxycinnamyl alcohol differing in their degree of methoxyation, p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols (Figure 4.92). Figure 4.93: Illustration of the diversity of monomers and polymer units present in lignins (Boerjan, Ralph, and Baucher 2003) When introduced in the lignin polymer the corresponding monolignols are named guaiacyl (G), sinapyl (S), and hydroxy-coumaroyl (H) units, respectively (Figure 4.93). The G, S, and H abbreviation letters are often used in the lignin literature. For example, the composition of lignin varies between plant species and tissues. In general, lignins from gymnosperms and related species (called softwood in English) are rich in G units and contains low amounts of H units, whereas lignins of angiosperm dicotyledons (flowing plants with reticulate or network-like leaf veins) are mainly composed of G and S units (corresponding to hardwood in English). For references only and to have some awareness of the diversity of the monomers and polymer units, Figure 4.93 has been added above. An example of a possible lignin structure is illustrated in Figure 4.94. It shows the great complexity of this second most important molecule on earth after cellulose. Figure 4.94: An example of a possible lignin structure. The portion shown here has 28 monomers (mostly coniferyl alcohol), 278 carbon atoms, 407 hydrogen atoms, and 94 oxygen atoms. Karol Głąbpl.wiki On an interesting note, it has recently been shown that polymerization of the monolignols is not random, but that monolignols are first assembled into lignol dimers (two monolignols), referred to as lignans. Lignans are thus dehydrodimers of monolignols (Davin et al. 1997; reviewed in Wang et al. 2013). There seems to be a plethora of lignans in nature, but exploring the literature on these reveals that some lignans, after ingestion by mamals may have anti-cancer properties! For the record and in case you are fascinated by how things are connected, some of the names and structures of these lignans are rather indicative of where they have been found or associated. For example in Figure 4.95, you can see that one of them is called pinoresinol, suggesting links with pine and resin. Another one is called lariciresinol. Larix is the genus name of the larches tree in English. Another one secoisolariciresinol, the prefix secoi-, likely having to do with sequoia, and so on. Podophyllotoxin at the left bottom is found in the toxic American mandrake, or ground lemon plant, but also on some flax seeds, and seems to be an interesting anti-oxidant for colon cancer (Fuss 2003). Figure 4.95: Hypothetical biosynthetic pathway leading from coniferylalcohol to podophyllotoxin showing a variety of lignans or lignol dimers used in the biosynthesis of lignin, but also having antioxidant properties beneficial for the health of mammals (Fuss 2003) Learning outcomes at the end of this section on phenolics, you should be able to: Lignins Know that lignins are the second most abundant organic polymers on earth Recognize that lignins provide stiffness to cell walls and allowed the emergence out of water of terrestrial vegetation to compensate for the lack of support in a gaseous milieu Know that lignins are polymers of monolignols and that the latter are phenylpropanoids 4.7 Alkaloids 4.8 Glucosinolates Glucorafanin Glucoraphanin References "],["aerobic-and-anaerobic-respiration.html", "Chapter 5 Energy generation and aerobic respiration 5.1 Generating energy: transfer of electrons 5.2 Generating energy without combustion: ATP or the energy currency of the cell 5.3 The ATP manufacture: substrate-level versus oxidative phosphorylation 5.4 Respiration: providing most ATP thanks to exogenous electron acceptors and oxidative phosphorylation 5.5 Respiration electron flow schemes 5.6 Glycolysis: an ancient way to produce ATP from glucose by substrate-level phosphorylation 5.7 The citric acid or Krebs cycle as an efficient way to transfer high energy electrons 5.8 Fermentation or staying alive without exogenous electron acceptor", " Chapter 5 Energy generation and aerobic respiration 5.1 Generating energy: transfer of electrons Chapter summary: Living organisms have found ways to release energy stored as electrons on organic molecules without combustion The energy currency and intermediate is the magical ATP molecule The ATP molecule releases energy without the transfer of electrons thanks to the phosphoanhydride bond The synthesis of most ATP molecules is driven by the Proton Motive Force created by a proton gradient maintained by proton pumps, themselves powered by electron transfer molecules (NAD and FAD) recharged through the Krebs cycle by electrons originally stored on organic carbon. The transfer of energy and electrons can be summarized in respiration schemes illustrating the electron donors, acceptors, and the byproducts of oxidation and reduction. 5.1.1 Activation energy barrier Us humans have the freedom to go about as we wish on our planet. All we need is to eat, drink, breath, and eliminate what we do not need. We could take our automobile cars as another example of bodies able to move about as long as they are fed some fuel. A lot of energy is released from combustion of fuel or wood. In fact, provided that this energy be funneled into some very smart mechanical systems (e.g., combustion engines), and the energy power delivered is largely superior to any power any human could output. However, the energy consumed is also phenomenal and much of it is lost through heat. Life has found a way to be a lot more parsimonious with energy spending, which makes living organisms to be a lot more energy efficient than combustion in the long run: the respiration process. But in both cases of combustion or of respiration, energy is liberated or transferred to ATP, respectively, when electrons are transferred from an electron donor to an electron acceptor. Not surprisingly, life and its diversity as we know it, has been able to develop on our planet because primary producers have been able to transfer and store solar energy into a chemical energy, where electrons are effectively stored onto organic molecules, and, because dioxygen \\(O_2\\), the most powerful electron acceptor, is freely floating in our atmosphere. But, then if we are nothing but a lot of organic matter, therefore a very large source of electrons, and if we live in an oxygenated environment, how come we are not readily going into combustion? Obviously this applies to all living organisms. Some of you might think that it is because of the water. But then why would not a very dry piece of paper, or leaf, not automatically catch on fire? The main answer lays in two words: activation energy. Electrons do not readily transfer from an electron donor to an electron acceptor because of the activation energy barrier which must be overcome. Activation energy is the level of energy necessary to be overcome for a reaction to carry on. On the Figure below, the energy difference between the peaks and the final energy level corresponds to the activation energy Ea. Figure 5.1: Activation Energy (Ea) needed for a reaction to proceed. (Ea) can be lowered thanks to a catalyst, and in the case of the respiration chain of living organisms, many of them. Figure borrowed from Nature Scitable, Copyrighted free use In normal conditions, this energy is preventing a reaction to proceed. This is why wood and most organic matter do not go into combustion or decomposition on their own. Nitroglycerin is notoriously unstable and the activation energy for electrons to be transferred to \\(O_2\\) is very small, hence its propensity to explode and its danger. However, the activation energy can be overcome with enough heat brought near an electron donor in the form of a flame or a spark. 5.1.2 Electron transfer during methane combustion Let us take a simple example to show that a lot of energy can be generated during an everyday life action, and how and where exactly the electrons are transferred. During the combustion of natural gas (\\(CH_4\\)) electrons are transferred from the carbon of methane to the oxygen atoms such that one can write: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_4 + 2 O_2 \\Rightarrow CO_2 + 2 H_2O \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] Because there are as many moles of reactant gases as there are of product gases, i.e., 3 moles of products for 3 moles of reactants in this case, this reaction is not explosive, which is the reason why we can use it without danger for cooking and heating. In this reaction, electrons are transferred from methane, which has the role of the electron donor, to dioxygen, which has the role of the electron acceptor. But where again were the electrons stored on methane to start with? We have seen in Chapter 2, that it is possible to use the electronegativity concept to visualize on which atom the electrons are stored. For \\(CH_4\\), carbon being more electronegative than hydrogen, the electrons are stored on the carbon atom (see Table 2.1). The byproduct of carbon losing its electrons is \\(CO_2\\), as carbon has zero electron for itself in \\(CO_2\\) (Figures 2.5 and 2.6; Table 2.1). The byproduct of oxygen atom accepting electrons \\(H_2O\\) as, in water oxygen has 8 electrons for itself (Figure 2.3). Overall, it is possible to visualize electon donor(s) and acceptor(s), as well of the by products of losing and gaining electrons in electron flow schemes such as that illustrated in Figure 5.2 for the combustion of methane. Again, the electrons are transferred from methane, i.e., the electron donor, to dioxygen, i.e., the electron acceptor, the byproduct of carbon losing its electrons is \\(CO_2\\) and that of oxygen gaining electrons is \\(H_2O\\). Figure 5.2: Summary of the transfer of electrons during oxidative combustion of methane, illustrating the electron donor, acceptor, the byproducts, and the energy released In reality, during combustion of methane, two processes are at play: the carbon of methane loses all its electrons, and we say it has been oxidized, and \\(CO_2\\) is the result of this oxidation reaction, and, each of the oxygen atoms gains electrons, and we say they have been reduced, and \\(H_2O\\) is the result of this reduction reaction. Each process can be consigned into what we refer to as half redox reactions (equation (5.2) and (5.3)): Oxidation of methane: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_4 + 2H_2O \\rightarrow CO_2 + 8 H^+ + 8 e^- \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] Reduction of dioxygen: \\[\\begin{equation} 2O_2 + 8 H^+ + 8 e^- \\rightarrow 4H_2O \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] The first half-reaction (5.2) shows nicely that indeed, the full oxidation of methane corresponds to the loss of all electrons that the carbon atom had for itself according to our electronegativity rule, yielding 8 electrons ‘up for grab’. It also shows that the oxygen atoms on the \\(CO_2\\) come from water, and not from \\(O_2\\). The second half-reaction (5.3) shows that indeed, it is the oxygen atoms that can readily accept electrons should they have access to them (the \\(H^+\\) are bystanders here as oxygen steals any electrons from \\(H\\) in \\(H_2O\\)). It also shows that all electrons gained on the oxygen atoms result in \\(H_2O\\) molecules. However, there is no such thing as ‘free floating electrons’, so an oxidation half-reaction is always accompanied with a reduction half-reaction, and vice versa (an entire chapter is dedicated to redox processes and more details are provided at the end of this chapter). So in reality, the resulting actual reaction that occurs is methane combustion where two moles of \\(O_2\\) oxidize one mole of \\(CH_4\\) (equation (5.4)) as seen below. It is important to notice that equation (5.1) taken by itself can be somewhat misleading as it might suggest that some of the reduced oxygen may end up on \\(CO_2\\). Equation (5.4) is more appropriate as it shows that the oxygens of \\(CO_2\\) are coming from \\(H_2O\\) on the left side of the equation, and that the reduction of \\(2 \\space O_2\\) yields \\(4 \\space H_2O\\) on the right side of equation. Both equations are technically correct but the simplification made on equation (5.1) hides actual processes. \\[\\begin{equation} \\color{orange}C\\color{gray}{H_4} + \\color{red}{2O_2} + 2 \\color{gray}{H_2}O \\Rightarrow \\color{orange}CO_2 + \\color{red}4 \\color{gray}{H_2}\\color{red}O \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] Combining the electronegativity concepts described in Chapter 2 with oxidation and reduction processes, it is possible to further summarize methane combustion showing the losses and gains of electrons on respectively the carbon and oxygen atoms in the modified electron transfer scheme below (Figure 5.3). Figure 5.3: Summary of the transfer of electrons during oxidative combustion of methane showing Lewis dot structures. The carbon atom of \\(CH_4\\) has 8 electrons for itself and loses them all to form \\(CO_2\\) during oxidation (left side of the scheme). Each oxygen atom has 6 electrons for itself in \\(O_2\\) and gains 2 electrons during the reduction process (right side of the scheme). Because there are twice as many moles of \\(O_2\\) involved, a total of 4×2=8 electrons are gained by the oxygen atoms during oxygen reduction, corresponding to those lost during methane-carbon oxidation. The overall combustion reaction can be summarized as methane oxidation by dioxygen This simple everyday life example showed very important aspects of the transfer of electrons, poining out electron donors, acceptors, and the byproducts of the oxidation and reduction processes. But for methane, a lot of energy is release during combustion, almost instantaneously, however. This method of releasing energy is not really ubiquitous and certainly not reversible at an affordable energy cost… So clearly life had to find better solutions: to generate energy in a process which would allow the energy delivery not to be too large, and not burn up as such would have the products or elements of energy delivery be recyclable, or the energy system be “rechargeable” at the molecular scale 5.2 Generating energy without combustion: ATP or the energy currency of the cell Section summary: A lot of energy can be unleashed at once during transfer of electrons in a process such as combustion. However, this process is not easily reversible nor recyclable within cells The solution nature has found is the release of energy, NOT associated with the transfer of electrons, but rather embedded in the ATP molecule ATP is a small ubiquitous molecule that can reach anywhere and support any metabolic process in the cell, and that can be easily rebuilt to serve again The very high density of lone pairs of electrons packed in the phosphate tri-tetrahedra in ATP create a permanent tension, which upon breaking of one of the phospho-anydride bond ‘releases energy’ The byproducts of this tension release, ADP + Pi, can be, at the molecular scale, mechanically bonded back together to form most ATP again Now because none of us and all the living organisms with us, burn to generate energy, there must be other systems to manage to liberate energy, and, there must be ways to have much lower activation energy. Life has found several mechanisms to optimize the transfer of energy from organic matter to a magic molecule: ATP or Adenosine TriPhosphate. There are many ways of transferring energy. To heat a house in the western world, we most often have a centralized heating (and sometimes cooling) system, where the heat is generated, e.g., in a furnace, and then transferred to the rest of the house via pipes and the like. The equivalent system might be for mammals the blood that gets re-oxygenated with the lungs, before it delivers oxygen throughout the body. At the cellular level, however, ATP or Adenosine TriPhosphate (Figure 5.4) is created throughout the cell near the equivalent of the little furnaces: an entire organelle called mitochondria in eukaroytic cells, and ATPases directly at the innermembrane of prokaryotic cells. Needless to say, there is no combustion with the mitochondria or at the bacteria membrane, and yet there is transfer of electrons and energy delivered. The energy is transferred from the organic matter to ATP, and ATP being a relatively small molecule, can easily reach all metabolic processes, usually operated by proteins, which need energy to proceed (to overcome the activation energy mentioned above). Figure 5.4: ATP molecular structure containing adenosine (= adenine + ribose) and the three phosphate linked together with a pyrophosphate energy rich bond The key to storing energy is in the instability of the bond between the phosphates, which are often referred to as “high-energy bonds” (Lipmann 1941), although this denomination has been heavily criticized because it might be misleading (e.g., Lehninger 1965). The hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate bond or diphospho anhydride linkages in ATP releases a lot of energy (ΔG°′ = -32 kJ mol-1), hence the original naming of Lipmann (1941). A common representation of this reaction is \\(ATP \\Rightarrow ADP + P_i\\) with the Pi referring to as a dioxygenated phosphate, i.e., a phosphoryl \\(-PO_3^{2-}\\). In practice though and as represented in Figure 5.5, the same reaction is actually \\(ATP + H_2O \\Rightarrow ADP + HPO_4^{3-} + H^+\\) (Figure 5.5). But in reality, it is not the ‘breaking of’ the pyrophosphate bond that releases energy as most bond breaking are endergonic (consume energy), but rather it is the fact that the molecular products (ADP +Pi) are more stable than ATP as all the bonds in ADP and in phosphate are lower in energy. Indeed, there seems to be three factors explaining the exergonic nature of of ATP hydrolysis (Moran 2012): the concentration of electrons at the diphospho anhydride bond creates great instability between bonded phosphate tetrahedra (Degens 1989) because of electrostatic repulsion among the negatively charged oxygen atoms the products of hydrolysis, ADP and inorganic phosphate, or AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate, are better solvated than ATP itself. When ions are solvated, they are electrically shielded from each other. The decrease in the repulsion between phosphate groups helps drive hydrolysis (Moran 2012) the products of hydrolysis are more stable than ATP. The electrons on terminal oxygen atoms are more delocalized than those on bridging oxygen atoms, creating resonance stabilization All of this, combined with the fact that the ATP:ADP ratio is maintained around 1,000 in cells, leads to the fact that ATP is the main source of energy transfer in cells and as such is referred to as the energy currency of the cell. The exergonic nature of the ATP hydrolysis is the fundamental principle for the release of energy from ATP, Adenosine Tri-Phosphate. Figure 5.5: Release of energy ATP hydrolyzed into ADP. http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/atp.html Now that we have allocated electrons on atoms and molecules, you easily understand that the number of electrons on the outside of the triplet \\(PO_3-O-PO_2-O-PO_2\\) is huge. In his fantastic book, Degens (1989) suggests that because of the plethora of electrons on the triphosphate part of ATP, because the tetrahedral phosphate molecules are linked together by one of the corners of each tetrahedron (Figure 5.6), and because of the \\(\\pi\\) electron bonds (double bond) which tends to repulse each other (Degens 1989), the triphosphate molecule can only be in constant movement, which ‘maintains the animated world’ (Degens 1989). Figure 5.6: A 3D view of the ATP molecular structure. Notice the three phosphate tetrahedral configuration (phosphorus in orange at the center of tetrahedra formed by the red oxygen atoms) of each of the phosphate molecule which when linked together are in constant movement because of the large density of electrons bundled together 5.3 The ATP manufacture: substrate-level versus oxidative phosphorylation Section summary: Phosphorylation of ADP into ATP occurs during two pathways: substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation Both phosphorylation are indirectly associated with the transfer of electrons originally stored on glucose Oxidative phosphorylation is a three times as efficient to produce ATP per electron transferred than substrate-level phosphorylation The beauty of \\(ATP \\Rightarrow ADP + P_i + energy\\) is that the ingredients to store the energy are still there, namely ADP and Pi and their oxidation states have not changed, or in other words, they have not lost electrons. Manufacturing back ATP is thus possible within the cell by reversing the previous reaction into \\(ADP + P_i + energy \\Rightarrow ATP\\). Obviously, this reaction requires to energize the electrons of the phosphate back to a higher level to recreate the phosphoanhydride bond. If ATP freely releases energy for a reaction to proceed in the cell, as ATP is hydrolysed into ADP + Pi, there must be energy at one point to ‘manufacture’ or recharge the ATP molecule in the first place. We have seen that much of the energy in the cell is transferred thanks to the ATP molecule. So could one just make ATP from the energy liberated by ATP? The answer is no, obviously… The energy to create ATP has to come from elsewhere, otherwise it just cannot work. Life has found two wonderful ways to recreate the phosphoanhydride bond thanks to what are referred to as substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation. The substrate-level phosphorylation is reviewed later in the glycolysis part of this chapter. These two phosphorylations occur within two main suites of processes called respiration and fermentation. The big difference between respiration and fermentation is the presence or absence, respectively, of exogenous electron acceptors (Figure 5.7). Before there might be any confusion, the manufacture of ATP is associated, indirectly, with the transfer of electrons, BUT, the hydrolysis of ATP and the phosphorylation of ADP do NOT involve the transfer of electrons. Because of this, it is important to account for the number of ATP molecules produced during the transfer of electrons, hence the following development. Both respiration and fermentation start with a cascade of reactions collectively referred to as Glycolysis. The suffix -lysis means ‘breaking’ and the prefix glyco- stands for glucose. Glycolysis is the suite of processes that break glucose, and in fact break glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. Although more details are provided in the a dedicated section, glycolysis results in the net formation of 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation and the transfer of 4 electrons out of each glucose molecule. The formation of 2 ATP during glycolysis can only continue to occur if the 4 electrons taken out of glucose have some place to be accepted. Otherwise, glycolysis stops. In abscence of exogenous electron acceptors, i.e., electron acceptors from outside the cell, these four electrons are accepted onto organic molecules to form well known products such as ethanol, acetic acid, lactic acid, butyric acid, or even H2 (details in the the fermentation part of this chapter). In the end, most of the electrons originally stored on glucose are still stored onto organic molecules in fermentation. And this is one reason why fermentation provides little energy in the form of ATP (only 2 ATP for each glucose molecule). Figure 5.7: Transfer of electrons from glucose generates 18 times more ATP in respiration than in fermentation. Most of the ATP (30-32 or 90%; illustrated in red text) is produced during the oxidative phosphorylation of respiration, while 4 ATP (10%) are produced by substrate-level phosphorylation (illustrated in green text) during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Electrons transported on organic molecules are framed in rectangle boxes, and those tranported on Electron Transfer Molecules are framed in ‘explosion boxes’ Reversely, in respiration, the 24 electrons originally on the glucose can be all transferred to exogenous electron acceptors. The big difference occurs after glycolysis: all the electrons stored on glucose eventually power the oxidative phosphorylation processes (Figure 5.7). The twenty four electrons originally stored on glucose generate up to 36 ATP molecules, or 1.5 molecules of ATP per electron transferred on average, compared to 0.5 ATP produced per electron transferred during glycolysis, and thus in fermentation. Obviously the mechanism for creating ATP after glycolysis must be very different in respiration than in fermentation. And the difference is in the oxidative phosphorylation that occurs after the Krebs cycle. There must be a secret for oxidative phosphorylation to be so much more efficient. The next section explores this secret. Because the oxidative phosphorylation generates about 90% of ATP produced, the next section are focused on this very process. Description of the glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are provided afterwards, although they truly occur upstream of the oxidative phosphorylation, because both are associated with substrate level phosphorylation. 5.4 Respiration: providing most ATP thanks to exogenous electron acceptors and oxidative phosphorylation Section summary: Phosphorylation of ADP to ATP for the oxidative phosphorylation occurs thanks to a mechanical attachment of Pi to ADP The mechanical force is provided by a Proton Motive Force associated with the powerful flow of protons from the inter-membrane space out at the ATPase sites, which act as “proton mill” at the innermembrane Protons naturally flow at the ATPase sites because of an actively maintained gradient between the inter-membrane space and the cytoplasm The glycerophospholipid bilayer allows to form a proton-tight compartment, where the ATPase provide an exit Electrons transferred from glucose to NADH and FADH2 power proton pumps, which supply the inter-membrane space with protons NADH and FADH2 act as intermediate electron transfer molecules between the reduced carbon on the organic matter and the proton pumps The protons exiting at the ATPase are consumed in the cytoplasm during the reduction of \\(O_2\\), which accepts the electrons originally on reduced carbon and the protons to form \\(H_2O\\). Electrons pass through a suite of protein complexes and coenzymes referred to as the electron transfer chain Because this phosphorylation is associated with the oxidation of the NADH and FADH2, it is referred to as the oxidative phosphorylation Again, respiration involves a cascading series of three suites of reactions/processes called: Glycolysis the Krebs or citric acid cycle, and the oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 5.7) 5.4.1 Oxidative phosphorylation through molecular mechanical forces For prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, most of the ATP are synthesized thanks to the oxidative phosphorylation of respiration as mentioned above (Figure 5.7; more details below). For eukaryotic cells, glycolysis takes place outside of the mitochondria, while the Krebs or citric acid cycle (named after Sir Hans Adolph Krebs) and the oxidative phosphorylations take place inside the mitochondria (Figure 5.8). Figure 5.8: Summary of cellular respiration with the ATP and electron transfer budget. Obtained from https://cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/847806852426104839/1240/10/scaletowidth The secret is that in oxidative phosphorylation, the energy of the electron is transferred into chemiosmosis, or an accumulation of protons inside designated compartments and organelles, which creates a proton gradient between the intermembrane space and the cytoplasm. This gradient drives a powerful proton flow at the equivalent of valves literally providing a mechanical force, referred to as the Proton Motive Force. ATP is formed from the assemblage of ADP and a dehydroxylated phosphate (i.e., a phosphoryl)thanks to the ATP synthase, or ATPase corresponding to valve mentioned before. The ATPase is activated or powered mechanically, very much like a water mill, by the proton flow (Figure 5.9). This mechanically forces the phosphoanhydride bond to be created (Figures 5.9 and 5.10) while the electrons are energized. This PMF-based mechanical phosphorylation is the secret of the efficiency (at least 3 times more) of the oxidative, compared to substrate level phosphorylation. Figure 5.9: Artist representation of the ATP synthase powered, almost mechanically by proton flows. By The original uploader was Asw-hamburg at German Wikipedia - Transferred from de.wikipedia to Commons by Leyo using CommonsHelper., CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8993938 The ATPase has a base embedded in the membrane, referred to as the FO region, and a ‘head’, which looks a bit like a ‘mushroom hat’ (Figure 5.10). The so called C-subunit ring rotates in the so called a-subunit of the base of the ATPase as a result of the proton flow and allows the phosphorylation of ADP. It is thus fair to call the ATPase a ‘proton mill’. Figure 5.10 shows very nicely how the mechanical force of the H+ flow is thought to allow the phosphoryl radical Pi to be attached to an ADP. In summary, this mechanical force is what generates the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. So this solves that part of the ATP synthesis. Now, another mechanism must be responsible for the formation of the proton flow. Figure 5.10: ATP synthase in action. Obtained with permission from HarvardX To make sure there be no confusion here, the expression phosphorylation corresponds to the effective addition of a phosphoryl \\(-PO_3^{2-}\\) radical to the diphosphate part of ADP (Figure 5.11). This is why the phosphorylation of ADP is summarized as \\(ADP + P_i \\Rightarrow ATP\\), where Pi is used to represent a phosphoryl group. Despite this, we still refer to as triphosphate for the ATP molecule, because practically a phosphoryl group is a dehydroxylated phosphate. The OH- produced combines with the flow of protons to form water. Figure 5.11: Phosphorylation: addition of a phosphoryl group to ADP to form ATP 5.4.2 Creating a proton gradient as a source of proton flow Until now, we have hardly mentioned where all this takes place. We are about to see where this happens. But first, let us take an analogy to better understand the proton flow responsible for the synthesis of ATP. Flow of matter just does not happen on its own, it only happens as a result of a gradient between a compartment and another. Using the water mill analogy, the reason why there is release of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the water is because there is a drop in elevation, and therefore in potential energy between the ‘compartments’ upstream and downstream the mill. To increase the hydraulic gradient, men throughout the world have built dams to create compartments and increase the hydraulic gradient between upstream and downstream the mill. So in the water mill analogy, the hydraulic gradient is maintained thanks to the dam which creates compartments, and to the continuous arrival of new water upstream and to the leaving of water downstream. So four things are necessary for the wheel to turn by the release of kinetic energy (which in the end and in the old days would grind wheat or corn grain; Figure 5.12): a system to compartmentalize water, a supply of water, a water mill rotation powered by water momentum, and, an outlet for the water so that is does not accumulate. Figure 5.12: The mechanical force of water flow to rotate a water mill wheel is possible thanks to the maintenance of water head gradient between upstream and downstream of the wheel. This gradient exists and is maintained thanks to a dam which creates upstream and downstream compartments, the supply of water upstream, and enough channel slope such that water does not accumulate downstream. After Malcolm.boura By analogy, the formation of ATP corresponds to the grain grinding; the proton flow corresponds to the water flowing that activates the mill wheel, and in our case the proton flow activates the ATPase. We now need to address the four parts of the system needed to have a proton gradient and flow, and a rotation of the ATPase: a compartment system in the intermembrane space, a proton supply system (to the intermembrane space), the ATP synthase powered by a proton flow exerting a Proton Motive Force, and, a system to use protons (in the outer membrane space) so the gradient is maintained. 5.4.3 A compartment to accumulate protons We saw earlier that the double phospholipid layer made the cell membrane. Well if one closes a membrane on itself, one will make a compartment or a balloon. It turns out that if one looks at a typical prokaryotic cell and at organelles in a eukaryotic cell (Figure 5.13), there are compartments formed between a cell wall and the plasma membrane for prokaryotic cells, and between two double layer phospholipid membranes for the eukaryotic cells. So in reality, it is a bit as if one were to create a space between two balloons. Figure 5.13: Artist representation of a prokaryotic cell and a mitochondrion from a eukaryotic showing the intermembrane spaces: between the cell wall and plasma membrane for the prokaryotic cell, and, between the outer and inner membranes for the mitochondrion. https://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/animals/animalmodel.html and By Kelvinsong - Own work, CC0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=27715320 At the end though, there exists for prokaryotic cells and mitochondria (and most organelles for eukaryotic cell) an outer and an inner membrane, which effectively create intermembrane spaces or compartments to accumulate ‘things’. The double phospholipid membrane is so strong and so tight that it is quite proton-tight, in part thanks to the cardiolipin phospholipids. In other words, if somehow protons accumulate in this intermembrane space, protons cannot leave easily through the membrane through diffusion, but rather can leave through designated areas. And yes, you guessed right, the designated area for protons to leave the intermembrane space is the ATP synthase. So to take another analogy, you can imagine an inner tube full of air under pressure, and although air can leave through the inner tube over long periods (that is why tires eventually go flat), air can only leave through the valve in large volumes. And if you were to put a little fan in front of the valve as you are releasing air, the fan would rotate. Imagine that this is essentially what happens: the ATPase is both the valve and the fan as it literally rotates with the proton flow. 5.4.4 A supply of protons for the intermembrane space: proton pumps Now, the next natural question is that in the case of an inner tube, somebody pumped some air into the tube to put it under pressure. Similarly, there must be a system that pumps protons into the inter-membrane space. And yes indeed, there are proton pumps that do the job. But again, these pumps must be powered by some sort of energy. Let us pause for a second. We have seen in section 5.1 that generally speaking, energy is generated from the transfer of electrons. But until now, we have not even mentioned electrons: only ATP and protons…? This is where electrons come in: energetic electrons transported onto electron transfer molecules are the ones that power the proton pumps! It is time to take a bird’s eye view again. Energy liberation exists when electrons are transferred from an electron donor to an electron acceptor. Life has found a way to capture this energy in the form of ATP, which allows transportation of energy to the needed places in the cell. So the energy transfer in the cell does not have to be totally instantaneous like combustion would be, and it can be spent exactly where it needs to be spent. Yet, the production of ATP is in fact generated by an electron transfer, but indirectly. No, electrons are NOT transferred from organic matter to ATP. Yes, electrons are ultimately transferred from organic matter to an electron acceptor, which in the case of aerobic respiration is \\(O_2\\). But just like the generation of ATP is indirectly linked to the electron transfer, the transfer of electrons from organic matter to the ultimate electron acceptor is also indirect. A set of molecules called electron transfer molecules, called NAD+ and FAD are intermediate carrier of electrons and are the ones which power the proton pumps as represented in Figure 5.14 below. Figure 5.14: Electron transport chain occur within complexes I to IV at the innermembrane of a mitochondrion for eukaryots, or, of the cytoplasm for prokaryots. NADH directly powers complex I and there is enough energy from these electrons to also power complexes III and IV to pump protons in the intermembrane space. Complex II accepts electrons from FADH2 molecule (itself reduced by succinate - from the Krebs cycle - within complex II) and these electrons combine with those originally from NADH to power complexes III and IV. Coenzyme Q or ubiquinone is an intermediate between complexes I and III, and between II and III while cytochrome c is an intermediate between complexes III and IV. The flow of electrons within the membrane is illustrated by pink arrows After Fvasconcellos A great summary of how electrons power the proton pumps in provided in the video in Figure 5.15. In short, there are four protein complexes referred to as Complexes I to IV (Figure 5.14). These protein complexes are configured to release the electron energy to pump electrons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. The ubiquinone molecule, isoprenoid described in chapter 4 is referred to as coenzyme Q in the video. Figure 5.15: Proton pumps in action. Coenzyme Q corresponds to ubiquinone Obtained with permission from HarvardX The bottom line is that the electrons that were originally on organic matter have enough energy to power proton pumps, even after glycolysis and transport onto NAD and FAD. Proton pumping results into the chemiosmosis and the proton motive force that provides the mechanical force to synthesize ATP. 5.4.5 Electron transfer molecules that power the proton pumps The two main electron transfer molecules in the respiration process are called NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide; Figure 5.16) and FAD (flavine adenine dinucleotide; Figure 5.17). These two nucleotides have the ability to be reduced (= gain electrons) and oxidized (= lose electrons), and because they are mobile, to carry electrons from the cell (bacteria) or mitochondrion (eukaryot) cytoplasm to the proton pumps. Actually, FAD in this context seems to be embedded into complex II and is reduced as succinate is oxidized into fumarate into the citric acid cycle (Figure 5.14). Figure 5.16: Molecular formula of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) in both oxydized and reduced states Figure 5.17: Molecular formula of Flavine Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) in both oxydized and reduced states Notice that reduction and oxidation of NAD+ and FAD are made possible and reversible thanks to the cyclic rings where nitrogen is involved, creating stabilizing resonance and pseudo-conjugation. 5.4.6 Transfer of electrons from the Organic Carbon to an electron acceptor So this answers the question of how the proton pumps are powered, but it is now time to look at the global fate of electrons: where do they come from and where do they end up? Actually, we already know the global answers to these questions: the electrons are stored unto the C, N, and \\(S\\) of organic molecules and they are eventually accepted by an electron acceptor; in the case of organotrophic aerobic respiration, \\(O_2\\) is the ultimate electron acceptor, and carbon atoms are the electron donors. Before there might be any confusion, in the aerobic respiration process that involves organic molecules as electron donors (we will see that inorganic molecules can also be electron donors), strangely enough, the only atom which donates electron is carbon while the nitrogen and sulfur atoms keep all their eight electrons. Specialized microbes, called lithotrophs, literally ‘feed on stone’, which means that their source of electron is from an inorganic molecule, have the ability to use ammonium, hydrogen sulfide, methane, but also reduced iron and manganese as electron donor (8 electrons available for ‘donation’) in their aerobic respiration chains (details in chapter 8). So all this to say that in aerobic respiration that involves organic matter, only the carbon atom donates its electrons. The organisms which use organic matter as electron donors are called organotrophs. We, as mammals and humans, are organotrophs. 5.4.7 Oxygen reduction and oxidative phosphorylation Let us start from the end of the process: the reduction of oxygen into \\(H_2O\\), as represented on Figure 5.14 above. As the NADH and FADH2 are powering proton pumps (which names include Complex I, III, and IV; see Figure 5.14), the electrons lose some of their energy and migrate within the phospholipid membrane from the Complex I to III and then IV, and, from complexes II to III, and then IV (Figure 5.15). Because of the involvement of many different proteins in this transport, this is referred to as the electron transfer chain. Because the NADH and the FADH2 molecules are oxidized (they have given up their electrons) enabling proton pumping, the whole process is referred to as oxidative phosphorylation. Within Complex IV (Figure 5.14), reaction (5.5) occurs: \\[\\begin{equation} O_2 + 4 e^- + 4 H^+ \\Rightarrow 2 H_2O \\tag{5.5} \\end{equation}\\] This is the place where the electrons are accepted!!! So now you know exactly where all this is happening! Is not that wonderful? So the electrons are accepted by \\(O_2\\) (remember on a molecule of \\(O_2\\), each oxygen atom only has 6 electrons for itself (Figure 2.4), so each can accept two more), and these electrons reduce oxygen into \\(H_2O\\). This has several consequences: the reduction of \\(O_2\\) also consumes 4 H+, which solves the necessity for an outlet for protons as they flow out of the inter-membrane space through the ATPase, which was the third condition to maintain a proton gradient the reduction of \\(O_2\\) obviously consumes electrons, which also provides an outlet for the electrons. In order words, if no electron acceptors are available, then the electrons at the proton pumps have no outlet, so the proton pumps are stalled, which in turn halts the maintaining of a proton gradient, which eventually stops the production of ATP. 5.5 Respiration electron flow schemes Section summary: In this section, electron transfer schemes are reintroduced. This is an efficient way to identify the electron donor(s), the electron acceptor(s), and the byproduct(s) of the oxidation and reduction processes involved in respiration These last sections were necessary but we now need to connect them with some of the practical consequences that concern ecological engineering. The electron donors are the fuel for all microbial processes involved in the substrate of ‘treatment systems’. The byproduct(s) of the loss of electrons originally stored on the electron donor(s) will be a source of inorganic molecules that matter When the electron acceptor is \\(O_2\\), this results in an oxygen demand which may have consequences on the overall oxygen level and may lead to anaerobic conditions, where other electron acceptors come in play We try to take advantage of the anaerobic conditions to dissipate or strip excess nutrients, e.g. \\(NO_3^-\\) We have already introduced the electron flow schemes for methane oxidation in section 5.1.2. Here we reintroduce this concept and apply it for respiration processes. Respiration schemes maintain some of the important drivers of the formation of ATP and yet highlight the reactants and products, and transfer of electrons occurring during respiration. In the first respiration scheme in Figure 5.18 below, the transfer of electrons is represented by the magenta wavy line. Electrons are transferred from an electron donor to an electron acceptor (reactants). The consequences of the transfer are represented in thicker light blue arrows. The first consequence of the transfer of electrons is the powering of proton pumps, which in turn create a proton gradient in the inter-membrane space, which result into proton flow creating the proton motive force (PMF), which gives the necessary energy to catalyze the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP. The products of oxidation, reduction, and phosphorylation are represented in black arrows. Figure 5.18: Generic respiration scheme illustrating the flow of electrons from an electron donor to and electron acceptor, the by-products of the respective oxidation and reduction, and the consequences on proton gradients and flow, which ultimately help catalyse the formation of ATP The respiration scheme is obviously an oversimplified representation of the what happens as described above, but generally holds true. Some ATP are generated during glycolysis and in association with the Krebs cycle, but represent 4 out of a total of 38, or about 10% of the total. So it is probably fair to simplify things to represent the majority of the processes (here 90%). The beauty of this scheme is that it applies to just about all types of electron donors and acceptors and associated microbial processes. 5.5.1 Aerobic respiration schemes for organotrophs In the next scheme, we take the classic example of aerobic respiration, where glucose is considered as the electron donor, and \\(O_2\\) the electron acceptor. Figure 5.19: Aerobic respiration scheme illustrating the flow of electrons from glucose to \\(O_2\\), the by-products of the respective oxidation and reduction being \\(CO_2\\) and \\(H_2O\\), and \\(H_2O\\). The consequences of the transfer of electrons on proton pumps, gradients and flow, which ultimately help catalyse the formation of ATP, do not change from the generic respiration scheme above We have seen in Table 2.1 in Chapter 2, that glucose stores a total of 24 electrons for an average of 4 electrons per carbon atom. The oxidation of all the carbon atoms of the glucose molecule liberates 24 electrons and \\(6CO_2\\), and thus \\(24H^+\\), and can be written as in the half-reaction (5.6) below: \\[\\begin{equation} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6H_2O \\rightarrow 6CO_2 + 24 H^+ + 24 e^- \\tag{5.6} \\end{equation}\\] However, the number of electrons and protons become a bit cumbersome and do not clarify the points we are trying to make. To simplify glucose and carbohydrates in general, it is customary (e.g., Stumm and Morgan 1996) to use \\(CH_2O\\) as a generic carbohydrate because in this case the carbon has 4 electrons for itself, and because one can simplify carbohydrates, on an energy basis, as a suite of alcohol groups bonded together (details in sections 3.2.6 and 4.2). The oxidation of one carbon atom of a generic carbohydrate as shown in redox half reaction (5.7), clearly releases 4 electrons: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + H_2O \\rightarrow CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\tag{5.7} \\end{equation}\\] Organisms which use organic molecules as electron donors are referred to as organotrophs, hence the title of this section. We shall see in Chapter 8 that some microorganisms are able to use inorganic molecules as their electron donors. In our case (Figure 5.19), the byproduct of glucose as the carbon atoms lose all their electrons becomes \\(CO_2\\) as show in half reaction (5.7). In turn, the electrons are accepted by \\(O_2\\) following redox half-reaction (5.3) \\[\\begin{equation} O_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightarrow 2H_2O \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] The combination of donating electrons from glucose (equation (5.7)), or organic matter illustrated in Figure 5.21, combined with the accepting of these electrons by \\(O_2\\) (reaction (5.3)), results in the combined overall summary of aerobic respiration: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + O_2 \\rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \\tag{5.8} \\end{equation}\\] You might recall, however, that for the combustion of methane earlier in this chapter, we saw that reaction (5.1) was somewhat misleading and reaction (5.4) gave a better visualization of where the electrons went. The same criticism may be made here with reaction (5.8), which might suggest that in this reaction, somehow \\(H_2O\\) detached itself from the generic carbohydrate \\(CH_2O\\), and that somehow \\(O_2\\) got ‘glued’ back to \\(C\\)… It is not that at all what is actually happening, as you now know! So a better writing of organotrophic aerobic respiration when carbohydrates are the electron donors may be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} (\\color{orange}C\\color{gray}{H_2}O + \\color{gray}{H_2}O) + \\color{red}{O_2} \\rightarrow \\color{orange}CO_2 + \\color{gray}2\\color{gray}{H_2}\\color{red}O \\tag{5.8} \\end{equation}\\] It is now apparent that the electron acceptance from \\(O_2\\) generates \\(2H_20\\), and that the \\(O\\) atoms that end up on the carbon, were already fully reduced in the reactants and ‘cling’ to \\(C\\) to keep their electrons. Combining the electron allocation information, the electron transfer scheme, and the half reactions of oxidation and reduction yields Figure 5.20. Figure 5.20: Combined electron transfer scheme with the electron allocation, the transfer of electrons, and the corresponding half redox reactions The third scheme (Figure 5.21), the generic term organic matter is used to show that in reality, not only glucose can be part of the electron transfer chain, but essentially all types of organic molecules, as represented in Figure 5.22. So the only difference with the previous scheme with glucose only, are the by-products of the catabolism of organic matter: \\(CO_2\\), \\(NH_4^+\\), \\(HS^-\\), and \\(PO_4^{3-}\\). We have seen in Chapter 4 what organic matter is in details, but for now, we already know from Chapter 2 that it contains \\(CHONSP\\) atoms. Figure 5.21: Aerobic respiration scheme illustrating the flow of electrons from organic matter to \\(O_2\\), the by-products of the oxidation of OM include ammonium, hydrogen sulfide and phosphate this time The important thing to notice here is that the \\(N\\) and \\(S\\) atoms, which in organic molecules possess 8 electrons for themselves, or are fully reduced1, stay reduced as byproducts of respiration. In other words, during aerobic respiration, only the carbon atoms are oxidized. This might appear odd as mentioned before, because there are electrons available for oxidation to take place. Lithotroph micro-organisms are specialized in taking advantage of these available electrons, as we shall see in Chapter 8. The important message here is that you can see that respiration processes essentially breakdown large molecules into small inorganic ones, and that in the case of respiration for organotrophs, the only atom to lose its electrons is carbon. Figure 5.22: Oxidative phosphorylation of organic molecules of carbohydrates but of other molecular families as well. Figure obtained from Essential Cell Biology from Garland Science If we think about this apparent oddity, \\(N\\) and \\(S\\) are a lot more electronegative than \\(C\\), so in the organotroph cell, it is a lot easier for oxygen to strip electrons from carbon than it is from \\(N\\) and \\(S\\). It might be worth taking a hydraulic analogy: in a soil, pore water will tend to drain through the area of a soil that has the highest hydraulic conductivity, or use the path of least resistance, totally by-passing areas of lower hydraulic conductivity. Chemically, it is just a lot easier to obtain electrons and energy out of the reduced carbon, and a lot harder to obtain them from amine (\\(-NH_2\\)) and thiol (\\(-SH\\)) radicals; this is why \\(N\\) and \\(S\\) stay in a reduced form as byproducts of organotrophic respiration. Again, several group of lithotrophs specifically target the electrons on ammonium and on Hydrogen sulfide, and use \\(O_2\\) as their electron acceptor (details in Chapter 8). Section 5.4 was dedicated to the procuction of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. It is now time to look in more details at the glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, which produce ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation, and which serve as primers to the oxidative phosphorylation processes. Again, all three are involved in respiration that includes a cascading series of three suites of reactions/processes called: Glycolysis the Krebs or citric acid cycle, and the oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 5.7) 5.6 Glycolysis: an ancient way to produce ATP from glucose by substrate-level phosphorylation 5.6.1 Substrate-level phosphorylation Section summary: Substrate level phosphorylation does not involve another source of energy (e.g., the proton motive force) to phosphorylate ADP Substrate-level phosphorylation involves the phosphorylation of ADP (and GDP) into ATP (and GTP) using the chemical energy released from an accompanying reaction. The accompanying reaction often involves the hydrolysis of an unstable phosphorylated compound where the phosphate released is recycled to phosphorylate ADP to ATP. Glycolysis consits, as its name indicates, in breaking glucose. This breaking is accompanied by a loss of 4 electrons, which are temporarily transferred onto the NAD+ electron transfer molecule, and, by the formation of a net 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. Remember what we said in section 5.2: one of the keys to life and to movement of molecules, was the plethora of electrons that were contained around the three tetraedra of the tri-phosphate end of ATP? Because of that, the level of energy of electrons has to be higher to keep the phosphates bonded together, and, the tetraedra consequently are in constant movement relative to each other because of electrostatic repulsions (and this is why hydrolysis of this bond generates more stable products and releases energy). This is certainly true among phosphates, but that is certainly also true for phosphate tetraedra that would be bonded to C2 or C3 molecules where there would be quite a few electrons nearby, like in the carbonyl (-C=O) or double carbon bonds (-C=C-) of the enol (-C=COH-) group (Figure 5.23). Figure 5.23: Highly unstable bonds associated with phosphates in ATP, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate. It is the presence of π double bonds that create an excess of high energy electrons near the phosphate, creating the highly unstable bonds, which upon hydrolosis and combined with the phosphoryl group, allows for substrate level phosphorylation In reality there is a short list of functional groups where highly unstable bonds can be formed (and represented with a skwingly line in Table 5.1): diphosphoanydrides, acyl phosphates, enol phosphates, phosphoramidates, and thioesters. Most of them involve phosphate, and have this double bond very close to the phosphate group (Table 5.1). One does involve the thioester bond. In the thioester bond, the sulfur, having two lone pairs and having d orbitals also have high electron density, although not quite as high as in phosphate, and the energy release after hydrolysis the thioester bond is not quite that of other groups where phosphate is involved. Table 5.1: List of organic compounds hosting highly unstable bonds because of the high density of electrons packed together between mostly phosphate and a double bond. In the thioester bond, the sulfur, having two lone pairs and having d orbitals also have high electron density, although the energy released after hydrolysis of the thioester bond is not quite that of that of other groups where phosphate is involved Class Bond Examples Diphosphoanhydrides pyrophosphates, ADP, ATP Acyl phosphates 1,3-biphosphoglycerate, acetyl phosphate Enol phosphates phosphoenolpyruvate Phosphoramidates phosphocreatine, phosphoarginine Thioesters acetyl-coA, acyl-coA This would be almost anecdotal if the thioester unstable bond were not involved in essential metabolic processes. It does seem that the “thioester bond might be primeval in the development of life” (Duve 1995) or in other words might have preexisted ATP. ATP might have essentially replaced thioester bonds later, although not entirely, in the development of life because it yielded more energy. As evidence, De Duve (1995) states that: thioesters are obligatory intermediates in several key processes in which ATP is either used or regenerated. Thioesters are involved in the synthesis of all esters, including those found in complex lipids. They also participate in the synthesis of a number of other cellular components, including peptides, fatty acids, sterols, terpenes, porphyrins and others. In addition, thioesters are formed as key intermediates in several particularly ancient processes that result in the assembly of ATP. Going back to the primary objective of this section: substrate-level phosphorylation involves the phosphorylation of ADP (and GDP) into ATP (and GTP) using the chemical energy released from an accompanying reaction. The accompanying reaction often involves the hydrolysis of a phosphorylated compound where the phosphate released is recycled to phosphorylate ADP to ATP. This is in fact what happens during glycolysis (Figure 5.25): the phosphate attached to the glycerate and the pyruvate backbones are highly unstable bonds because of the presence of the double bonds in 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate (Figure 5.23 and 5.24). ADP can react with these two molecules, which provide both the phosphoryl groups and the energy necessary for the substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP (Figure 5.24). In reality, in the Krebs or citric acid cycle, GTP, i.e., Guanine TriPhosphate is substrate-level phosphorylated as well using the energy release after hydrolysis of the thioester bond. We shall see that GTP formed during the citric acid cycle serves for the substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP into ATP. Figure 5.24: ‘High energy bonds’, represented with the skwigly line, associated with phosphates in ATP, 1,3 Bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, molecules of the pay off phases of glycolysis. It is the presence of π double bonds that create an excess of high energy electrons near the phosphate, creating the high energy release after hydrolysis of the phosphate bond, which, combined with the phosphoryl group, allows for substrate level phosphorylation 5.6.2 Energy investment and energy pay off phases of glycolysis Section summary: Glycolysis consists in breaking a glucose C6 molecule into two C3 pyruvate molecules and by doing so gaining 2 ATP and transferring high energy electrons onto NADH + H+ For glycolysis to start, glucose must be in the aldose chain form To weaken the C6 molecule, high electronegativities are added at both ends using phosphate groups. This is done thanks to ATP that brings the necessary energy and the phosphate groups. This corresponds to the energy investment phase where 2 ATP are invested This is followed by an energy pay-off phase that yields 4 ATP back through substrate level phosphorylation as four high energy electrons originally on glucose find their way onto NADH + H+ Now that we know what substrate-level phosphorylation is, it is time to summarize what glycolysis does and when substrate-level phosphorylation occurs. Glycolysis consists in breaking the molecule of glucose into two C3 molecules of pyruvate, thereby producing 2 molecules of ATP (Figure 5.7). The four electrons lost during this suite of reactions are transferred onto, or reduce, two NAD+ molecules, which in respiration are used to power the proton pumps. Firts, for glycolysis to start, glucose must be in the aldose form (Figure 4.4), or in the linear chain form, and not in the cycle form. To break the C6 glucose molecule, the bond at the center of the molecule must be somehow ‘weakened’. An efficient way to do that is to create large electronegativity at both ends of the C6 molecule (hence the need for the glucose to be in a chain form). And the moeity that packs a lot of electronegativity is phosphate. And what molecule has the energy and the potential to add phosphate moeities? ATP of course! So you read correctly: glycolysis to occur must first ‘invest’ two ATP molecules to add phosphate moieties at both ends of the glucose molecule (which technically becomes fructose 1,6-biphosphate; Figure 5.25). This phase is referred to as the energy investment phase of glycolysis. Once the original C6 molecule has been split into two C3 molecules (technically two glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate molecules; Figure 5.25), the energy invested can be caught back, and the four electrons and their energy lost during this breaking of glucose can be transferred, respectively, onto two NAD+ molecules and onto 4 ATP. This phase is referred to as the energy pay off phase. Reactions 1 to 5 in Figure 5.25 correspond to the energy investment phase where the C6 carbohydrate ends are phosphorylated by ATP. As the phosphorylated C6 carbohydrates are broken into two C3 carbohydrates, two carbon atoms are oxidized, i.e., lose two electrons each, which are transferred to the electron transfer molecule NAD+ (reaction 6 in Figure 5.25). The energy pay off phase corresponds to reactions 7 to 10 in Figure 5.25. The 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate (Figure 5.23) substrate-level phosphorylate ADP into ATP (Figure 5.28). Glysolysis can thus be summarized into \\[ Glucose + 2 \\space ATP + \\space 2\\space NAD^+ \\rightarrow 2 \\space pyruvates + \\space 2\\space (NADH + H^+) \\space + \\space 4 \\space ATP\\] The net production of ATP is thus 4 - 2 = 2 ATP produced during glycolysis, and 4 electrons transferred to NAD+ (during phase 6 in Figure 5.25), which also correspond to those written in green ‘explosion boxes’ in Figure 5.7. Figure 5.25: Glycolysis pathway energy investment phase (reactions 1-5), the electron transfer phase (reaction 6) to NAD+, and the energy pay off phase (reactions 7-10). Modified from opentextbc Energy wise, this is not a particularly efficient system to produce ATP. However, glycolysis is the only suite of reactions that exists throughout all the cells from the most ancient Archea to eukaryotic cells, and exists in all respiration and fermentation pathways. So although somewhat archaeic, glycolysis is the prerequisite for all other respiration processes. However, to proceed, the electrons transferred to NAD+ must be accepted somewhere else to ‘recycle’ the NAD so that it may accept electrons again during glycolysis. The 10 high energy electrons still stored on pyruvate at the end of glycolysis are, in the Krebs or citric acid cycle, also eventually transferred onto NAD and FAD electron transfer molecules, and serve to fuel the proton pumps. 5.6.3 Electrons fate and electron transfer molecules Electron transfer molecules such as NAD+ and FAD play the very important intermediate role of transporting highly energetic electrons from organic matter to electron acceptors, and while doing so power proton pumps. NADH and FADH2 in respiration are oxidized back while powering proton pumps because there is a demand for electrons by the exogenous electron acceptors (Figures 5.7, 5.14, and 5.15). But they are a bit like taxis which can only do their work of transporting people if they can pick up and deliver passengers: electron transfer molecules can ‘do their jobs’ if they can accept and deliver or donate their electrons afterwards. When they are fully reduced, they cannot accept additional electrons and must be oxidized before they can accept electrons again. Just like taxis that are full of people cannot take additional passengers, and can take passengers again only after they have brought them to their destination. In the presence of external or exogenous acceptors, oxidative phosphorylation can take place and the electrons are eventually accepted by electron acceptors, hence oxidizing NADH and FADH2 back to NAD+ and FAD. But in absence of exogenous electron acceptors, the NADH produced during glycolysis must too donate their electrons to allow the formation of the 2 ATP to go on. Endogenous molecules, namely organic molecules accept them, but at no energy gain: this is what happens during fermentation. (Figure 5.7). The bottom line is that, unless the electrons temporarily stored on the electron transfer molecules have an outlet, no ATP can be produced in cells. 5.7 The citric acid or Krebs cycle as an efficient way to transfer high energy electrons Section summary: The primary function of the citric acid cycle is to extract the high energy electrons originally from the glucose molecule and transfer them at little energy loss to the electron transfer molecules NAD+ and FAD As the carbons of the pyruvate are fully oxidized in the citric acid cycle, CO2 is the carbon byproduct Between the glycolysis and the oxidative phosphorylation, lies the suite of reactions referred to as the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle. The primary function of the citric acid cycle is to extract the high energy electrons originally from the glucose molecule and transfer them at little energy loss to the electron transfer molecules NAD+ and FAD. By doing so, the carbon is released as \\(CO_2\\), as we now know quite well that this is the simplest form in which carbon is the stable electron-less molecular form in an aerobic environment (see Table 2.1). The electron transfer molecules release these electrons by powering the proton pumps of the innermembrane for bacteria, and innermembrane of mitochondria for eukaryots. Unlike glycolysis, the citric acid suite of reactions is cyclic, in that the last element is the primer for the incorporation of new radical groups into the cycle. 5.7.1 Oxidation of pyruvate as a preliminary step There is a little mismatch between the Krebs cycle and pyruvate. Indeed, the citric acid cycle is composed of a series of 9 molecules which derive from one another from a C6 molecule (citric acid; view it as a propan-2-ol, each carbon of which would have a carboxyl group) to a C4 molecule (oxaloacetate), with only one C5 form in the middle (Figure 5.28). At the same time, for every glucose molecule, glycolysis produces two molecules of pyruvate, i.e., C3 molecules. The incorporation of a pyrurate into the citric acid cycle should make a C7 molecule (C4 + C3) and not a C6 as citric acid… Indeed, it is not pyruvate that is incorporated into the citric acid cycle, but a pyruvate that has lost a \\(CO_2\\), i.e., an acetyl group. Prior to entering the citric acid cycle, pyruvate is oxidized and loses a Carbon atom in the form of \\(CO_2\\) during a reaction referred to as pyruvate decarboxylation and performed by an enzyme called pyruvate dehydrogenase and the coenzyme vitamin B1 (Figure `5.26). Figure 5.26: Pyruvate decarboxylation transferring two electrons to NAD+ and forming Acetyl-CoA. By akane700 This reaction is actually rather complex and the details are not necessary here. However, it is important to retain that: the two electrons lost during decarboxylation of pyruvate are transferred onto NAD+ to form NADH the removal of \\(CO_2\\) from pyruvate creates an acetyl radical the energy liberated during oxidation allows the formation of a thioester bond (unstable but which hydrolysis liberates energy; Table 5.1) between the acetyl group and the famous coenzyme A to form the acetyl-CoA molecule the energy liberated during the hydrolysis of the thioester bond of the acetyl-CoA allows the incorporation of the acetyl group (C2 molecule) onto the last molecule of the Krebs cycle (oxaloacetate, a C4 molecule; Figure 5.28) to form citrate (C6) pyruvate, rather than losing a carbon to enter the Krebs cycle, can also accept an extra carbon, thanks to the pyruvate carboxylase provided energy be spent by hydrolysis of an ATP, to yield an oxaloacetate (Figure 5.28) 5.7.2 Transfer of all electrons to NAD+ and FAD Counting the number of electrons, pyruvate stores a total of 10 electrons stored on the carbon atoms, and the acetyl radical has 8 (Figure 5.27) Figure 5.27: Lewis dot structure of pyruvate and acetyl radical group illustrating the electron allocation on carbon atoms: 10 electrons on pyruvate and 8 electrons on the acetyl radical So, the complete oxidation of the acetyl radical should yield 8 electrons, and the molecular byproduct of this complete oxidation should be two molecules of \\(CO_2\\). Looking at the citric acid cycle illustrated in Figure 5.28, one can see that along the cycle 3 molecules of NAD+ are reduced to NADH and that during the oxidation of succinate into fumarate, two electrons are transferred onto FAD to form FADH2 (happening within Complex 2 of the electron transfer chain), for a total of 8 electrons. And along the cycle, two \\(CO_2\\) molecules are liberated. Things add up! So after recapitulation, for each glucose molecule originally storing 24 electrons (Figure 2.8), 4 electrons are lost during glycolysis to NAD+, leaving 2×10=20 electrons on 2 molecules of pyruvate. The decarboxylation of pyruvate prior to entering the citric acid cycle involves the loss of 2 electrons, or 2×2=4 electrons per glucose molecule. The 2×8= 16 electrons left on the acetyl radical lose their electrons to NAD+ and FAD in the citric acid cycle. Things also add up for each glucose molecule. Organotrophic aerobic respiration thus consists in fully oxidizing glucose molecules (and organic carbon in general) to \\(O_2\\) producing \\(CO_2\\) as the carbon byproduct. This is exactly what happens when we breath: we inhale air containing 21% of \\(O_2\\) and 0.04% of \\(CO_2\\), and exhale air containing about 16% of \\(O_2\\) and 4% of \\(CO_2\\). Not all \\(O_2\\) is consumed because of small residence time in the lungs, but the \\(CO_2\\) concentration is multiplied by 2 orders of magnitude (×100). Figure 5.28: Krebs or citric acid cycle pathway. After Narayanese, CC BY-SA 3.0 Notice that there is no ATP directly produced inside the citric acid cycle, but only GTP via substrate-level phosphorylation. But GTP then substrate-level phosphorylate ADP to form ATP (Figure 5.27). In Figure 5.29 below which summarizes all the aerobic respiration pathways, you can see that most of the ATP is formed thanks to the proton flow, and that electron transfer molecules are involved in all steps.

We can summarize the respiration process again in that order: the goal of respiration is to transfer energy initially stored as high energy electrons on organic molecules to ATP, the energy currency of the cell The production of ATP itself has to come from a different source of energy than that liberated by ATP itself Most ATP are synthesized by oxidative phosphorylation of ADP by the ATP synthase, itself powered by a proton flow from the inter-membrane space to the cytoplasm space the proton flow is powered by a proton gradient between the inter-membrane space and the cytoplasm space This gradient is made possible thanks to a proton-tight compartment corresponding to the intermembrane space a supply of protons from the cytoplasm to the intermembrane space, fed by proton pumps an outlet for the protons flowing out and powering the ATPase (‘the proton mill’), which combined with the reduction of oxygen to form water molecules The proton pumps are themselves powered by the oxidation of electron transfer molecules (NAD and FAD), which carry high energy electrons from the Krebs or citric cycle to the electron transfer chain The electron transfer molecules accept the electrons, or are reduced during glycolysis, before and during the Krebs cycle as organic carbon are oxidized or lose their electrons and release \\(CO_2\\) The other way to present respiration may be to say that: Energy rich electrons stored on organic molecules are transferred onto electron transfer molecules during glycolysis, and during the Krebs cycle For oxidative phosphorylation of ATP, the high energy electrons thus transported power proton pumps to pump protons in the intermembrane space of the cell for unicellular organisms or of the mitochodria for eukaryotic cells These pumps feed a supply of protons to the intermembrane space which, because this space is proton-tight, and because protons outlets are limited to the ATP synthase, creates an accumulation of protons in this space The accumulation of protons creates a proton gradient between the intermembrane space and the cytoplasm, which generates a proton flow at designated ‘valves’, i.e., the ATP synthase, in the membrane The protons flow out the intermembrane through the ATP synthase, which can be approximated by proton canals, provide a proton motive force capable of mechanically turn the ATPase head which acts as a ‘proton mill’ The rotation of the proton mill catalyzes the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP The proton gradient is maintained possible because the protons flowing out of the inter-membrane space are combined with electrons reducing oxygen into water The electron flow is maintained thanks to the same oxygen reduction, which in turns allows electron transfer molecules to be oxidized so that then can take their ‘eleqctron load’ again Overall respiration consists in transferring high energy electrons from organic molecules to oxygen (or other electron acceptor), and by doing so creating chemiosmosis or a proton gradient, which in turn is the main driver for the formation of most ATP in the cell Both summaries present the same story but have their own logic. Other important subtleties of respiration include: In the case organic molecules are the source of electrons, only the carbon atoms donate electrons, the amine and thiol radicals being eliminated as a by-product DO NOT donate their electrons in this respiration system. This is admittedly a bit weird as the the amine and thiol groups still have 8 electrons to donate each. 5.8 Fermentation or staying alive without exogenous electron acceptor ATP, the energy currency of the cell is necessary for life to exist and thrive. Again, it is the reversibility of \\[ATP \\rightarrow ADP + P_i\\] using mechanical energy (proton motive force) or substrate-level phosphorylation that makes this molecule so universal and essential for life of cells and organisms. In absence of exogenous electron acceptor, i.e., available through the environement, the electron transfer chain is shut down, and so is oxidative phosphorylation… So the only source of ATP left is glycolysis (only 10% of the ATP in normal respiration). But for glycolysis to keep functioning, the electrons transfered onto NAD+ must be accepted somewhere, otherwise glycolysis is stalled as well… This is where fermentation occurs: the electrons lost during glycolysis and transferred onto NAD+ are eventually accepted by endogenous electron acceptors, namely C2, C3, and C4 molecules. This section is still under construction In the next chapter, we will introduce all the respiration processes, aerobic and anaerobic, and performed by organotrophs and lithotrophs.

The secret is that in an aerobic environment with the atoms of oxygen in the dioxygen molecule being so eager to capture electrons, the electrons can freely and will naturally transfer from the organic molecules to oxygen. This electron transfer releases energy. We have seen that in the case of methane combustion, the electron transfer is direct, leading to the release of ephemeral heat and light, resulting in a large and sudden increase of entropy. But this type of energy release is just not sustainable for organisms which must find ways to minimize the energy release in the form of heat, and have a way to release the energy exactly where it is needed. It does need an intermediate and ubiquitous storage of energy. The secret is the phosphoanhydride bond of the ATP molecule, which can temporarily store lots of energy without the involvement of direct electron transfer. In the case of the oxidative phosphorylation, the formation of the phosphoanhydride bonds is thought to be mechanically induced between ADP and a phosphoryl group during the rotation of the ATPase, itself powered by a proton flow maintained between compartments. In the end the electron transfer only indirectly leads to the formation of ATP, by powering the proton pumps. It is thus fascinating that the release of the energy chemically stored onto high energy electrons on organic molecules involves many small steps, which essentially prevent the direct transfer from the electron donor to the acceptor, which would lead to combustion… The entire machinery works, in the long run, if somehow the source of organic molecules (= the source of electrons) is replenished, otherwise with a finite amount of organic molecules, the respiration process would eventually deplete all organic molecules on earth. So the corollary to the energy release in respiration, is the capture and storage of energy in a chemical form. And this is where it is very useful to be on a planet close enough to its star such that it receives enough but not too much energy. One of life’s secret has been to be able to capture this allochthonous source of energy, i.e., sunlight, and store it, and now you know in what form: in the form of high energy electrons onto organic molecules, and specifically on the carbon atoms as a first step. This chapter provides enough of the details of photosynthesis processes that lead to the formation of carbohydrates. 6.1 Requirements to store energy on organic molecules The famous “for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return” from Genesis (3:19; first book of the Hebrew Bible), is the oldest known description of what inorganic and organic molecules are: inorganic molecules correspond to the ‘dust’ in the quote, while organic molecules exist only as a temporary reprieve time on planet earth. Indeed, the widespread occurrence of dioxygen on planet earth imposes that in the presence of \\(O_2\\), the stable state of CHNSP atoms be the fully oxidized state. By now, we know that the fully oxidized state of these 5 atoms corresponds \\(H_2O\\), \\(CO_2\\) (or \\(CO_3^{2-}\\) or conjugated acids in water; Figure 2.6), \\(NO_3^-\\), \\(SO_4^{2-}\\), and \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) (and conjugated acids in water; Figure 2.7). In other words, the normal stable state of CHNSP on our planet is really ‘dust’ where CHNSP have ‘no’ available energy stored on them. Remember, it is the molecules with the -ate suffix: carbonate, nitrate, sulfate, and phosphate. What about this incredible life on our planet then? Yes, the big difference is that among CHNSP, the C, N, and S atoms have gained high energy electrons and have managed to keep the ‘electron kleptomaniac’ oxygen atom away enough from them. We know that in organic molecules, the C, N, and S atoms are present in some reduced form, while the P atom always stays oxidized in the phosphate or phosphoryl form. Hydrogen atoms, are always on an oxidized state, i.e., that they lose their electron to all other atoms. The N and S atoms always are fully reduced (disulfide bridge in proteins being an exception), i.e., that they each have 8 electrons for themselves and therefore have oxidation state of \\(5-8 = -3\\) for nitrogen and \\(6-8 = -2\\) for sulfur. The carbon atom is the one that behaves as the adjustment variable, as it can have from 1 to 7 electrons for itself for oxidation states or \\(4-1 = +3\\) to \\(4-7 = -3\\) (Table 2.1). In the end, life has managed to store electrons on only C, N, and S atoms. But on which atom does it happen first? Or does it happen in all three at the same time? Theoretically, it could really happen on all three atoms. An ideal atom for storing energy is an atom that is not scarce in the environment, for which a minimum of energy would be required to store high energy electrons, and that would be stable enough even when having oxygen bonded to it in addition to other atoms. Well, there is actually only one atom among C, N, and S able to do all that, and that atom is the carbon atom. This is not to say that N and S cannot eventually store electrons. They absolutely do, eventually. It is to say that the entry point for electron storage in life is the carbon atom. If the stable state of carbon in the aerobic environment of planet earth is carbon dioxide or carbonates where the carbon atom’s electrons have been stripped away, then there must be a mechanism to ‘beat’ the ambient thermodynamics. Specifically, there must be a source of electrons, a mechanism for energizing the electrons, to ‘attach’ them on the carbon atoms, and prevent the electrons to automatically be stripped away by \\(O_2\\). The source of electrons is the oxygen atom of water, and the mechanism is called photosynthesis. No, there is no error. Although we have said that oxygen, because of its electronegativity, does not donate electrons to CHNSP, under enough allochthonous energy, it can and will. In photosynthesis, this energy is light, and this energy is strong enough to strip electrons from the oxygen atom of the \\(H_2O\\) molecule in a reaction that we call photolysis. In summary, the entry point for electron storage in life requires these primary conditions: a source of electrons a mechanism to strip these electrons from their source a mechanism to energize these electrons the energy to ‘attach’ these electrons onto the \\(C\\) of \\(CO_2\\) a mechanism to ‘attach’ these electrons onto \\(C\\) of \\(CO_2\\) These five conditions listed above occur during two major phases referred to as the light reactions (conditions 1 to 4 included), which occur in the presence of light, and the carbon reactions or dark reactions (conditions 4 and 5), which do not require light to occur. 6.2 No need to reinvent the wheel for the production of ATP and the transfer of electrons Just as for respiration, the ATP Chapter still under construction "],["anabolism.html", "Chapter 7 Anabolism and the sources of nutrients for organisms 7.1 Requirements to store energy on organic molecules 7.2 No need to reinvent the wheel for the production of ATP and the transfer of electrons", " Chapter 7 Anabolism and the sources of nutrients for organisms Chapter summary: In the previous chapter, we have seen the way life has found to release the energy stored in high energy electrons on organic molecules.

We took aerobic respiration as our model to determine that most of the ATP produced in the cell is principally due to a proton flow from the inter-membrane space to the cytoplasm, for microbial cells and within the mitochondria for eukaryotic cells (Figure 5.29). In the middle of Chapter 5, we introduced respiration schemes as a very handy method to summarize the important drivers and consequences of respiration: the electron donors, the electron acceptors, and the byproducts of both oxidation and reduction. In this chapter we are going to explore the diversity of electron donors and acceptors present in nature, many of which represent important processes for ecological engineering. As a first step, we will use a theoretical wetland soil to explore some of the variety of respiration schemes. We will take advantage of these processes at play in wetland soils to explore the consequences on concentration gradients and movement of molecules of importance in environmental and ecological engineering. We will then introduce additional ways microbes have found to obtain their energy, and summarize the whole using the different prefixes for the word ‘trophs’. 8.1 The theoretical vertical sequence of respiratory processes in wetland soils For this we will use a theoretical wetland soil to illustrate our point. Such theoretical soil has ‘enough’ organic matter content for microbial respiration to take place throughout its profile, ‘enough’ of other sand, silt, and clay and all the minerals that accompany them, including iron and manganese oxides. Let us assume that this theoretical soil, is sufficiently moist and aerated for microbial aerobic respiration to take place throughout the soil profile. Let us then assume that this soil is suddenly flooded, and let us explore the consequences of this. Respiratory processes are going to occur on a temporal sequence, which in fact will be mirrored by a vertical sequence of processes in the wetland sediment. 8.2 An aerobic layer near the soil-water interface 8.2.1 Oxygen supply and demand at the sediment water interface The content or concentration of chemicals in any open liquid and gaseous systems results from the balance between supplies and demands. For example, the 21% of \\(O_2\\) in the atmosphere is a dynamic equilibrium between all the supplies of dioxygen to the atmosphere (mostly through photosynthesis), and all the demands. The same applies to gases, ions, and others dissolved in water. Let us now list the demands and supply of dioxygen at the top of the sediment. 8.2.1.1 Organotrophic aerobic respiration as oxygen demand At the top of the wetland sediment, one can imagine that there will be fresh organic matter containing reduced carbon atoms, which microbes could as a source of energy, i.e., electrons in their respiration chain, and potentially also as a source of nutrients. And indeed, this is exactly what happens. Organotrophic microbes generate ATP for their metabolic needs by releasing the energy originally stored on the carbon atoms of organic matter through the transfer of electrons to dioxygen, which serves as electron acceptor. This demand for dioxygen can be further summarized as organotrophic aerobic respiration. The suffix troph means feed on. In reality this suffix is rather vague and has been applied to qualify for organisms their source of carbon, electrons, and energy (details in section 17.16.1). Here, the word organotrophic means that the source of electrons, also referred to as reducing power, are the carbon atoms of organic matter. This is to differentiate from other sources of electrons that are not organic (in this case, lithotrophic as described below). Aerobic means that the electron acceptor is dioxygen, as opposed to the cases when dioxygen is not the electron acceptor, in which case the word anaerobic would be used. Respiration means that the transfer of electrons is a microbially mediated process corresponding to the production of ATP, as opposed to the cases where transfer of electrons is purely chemical and does not involve microbes. We have already presented in details the important steps at the molecular and membrane level of organotrophic aerobic respiration in Chapter 5 and summarized it in section 5.5.1). In Figure 8.1, we provide another view of organotrophic aerobic respiration using the electron transfer respiration scheme, to which the redox half-reactions have been added. We know since Chapter 4 that organic matter is, in its vast majority, composed of the \\(CHONSP\\) atoms, principally assembled into carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and phenolics. We chose to summarize the formula of a generic organic matter as \\((CH_2O)_nN_xS_yP_z\\) to highlight the fate of each of the atoms. In the respiration processes, the entry molecule to the citric acid cycle is the acetyl radical \\(-CO-CH_3\\), on which 8 electrons are available on each carbon, for an average of 4 electrons per carbon atom (see Figure ??). This fittingly corresponds to the generic carbohydrate we introduced in section 5.5.1 and summarized as \\(CH_2O\\). As a result, it is fair to assume that for each carbon atom present in organic matter to be used as a fuel for respiration, 4 electrons are available, and for \\(n\\) carbon atoms, \\(4n\\) electrons are available, hence the use of \\((CH_2O)_n\\). We also know that the nitrogen and the sulfur atoms are assembled into amine and thiol groups, i.e., the atoms are fully oxidized and have 8 electrons for themselves. Phosphorus stays as fully oxidized in the form of phosphate \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) or phosphoryl \\(-PO_3^{2-}\\) groups and is incorporated as such in organic matter. Figure 8.1: Combined electron transfer scheme with the electron allocation on the carbon of organic matter, the transfer of electrons, and the corresponding half redox reactions. Generic organic matter is summarized as \\((CH_2O)_nN_xS_yP_z\\). During organotrophic aerobic respiration, carbon is fully oxidized into \\(CO_2\\), while the atoms of \\(N\\), \\(S\\), and \\(P\\), stay in the oxidation state when assembled in organic matter. The oxidation states for \\(NSP\\) as byproducts of respiration respectively are -III, -II, and +V, corresponding to \\(N\\) and \\(S\\) having 8 electrons for themselves, and \\(P\\) having none The additional information provided in figure 8.1 are the redox half-reactions, compared to Figure 5.21. We added these to further illustrate that in organotrophic aerobic respiration, only the carbon atoms get oxidized. the other atoms keep their oxidation state, in other words their electrons if they have any, as they did when assembled transferring electrons originally and the consumption of oxygen by microbes corresponds to what w At first, all micro-organisms are going to use dioxygen that might be present in the pore space. But because pore space is now getting filled with water, it is possible that the amount of oxygen available for microorganisms might change. And yes, indeed, water does not have nearly the capacity to provide oxygen as air does for several reasons: at 15°C in water there are about 10 mg of \\(O_2\\) in one liter of water. Comparatively, in one liter of air, there is about 300 mg of \\(O_2\\), or 30 times more. How does one calculate this? At standard conditions, 1 liter of air at 21% oxygen possesses 0.21 L of oxygen. Since for these conditions, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L, simply divide 0.21/22.4, to arrive at 0.0094 moles of oxygen. Then the mass of oxygen in 1 liter of air is 0.0094×32 g/mole = 300 mg. A lot more details are available in Chapter 13 on dissolution of gases in water. the diffusivity (which quantifies the ability of elements to move about) of \\(O_2\\) in air is 0.176 cm²/s while that of \\(O_2\\) in water is 2.10×10−5 cm²/s, or more than 8,000 times smaller (Wikipedia contributors 2017) In other words, it is good to remember that the amount of oxygen available in water compared to air is about 30 less, and that oxygen in water moves more than 8,000 slower in water than in air. So, one can clearly see that the potential supply of oxygen from flooded porewater is thus a lot more limited than in aerated pore space. Now, where is the potential source for supply of oxygen for our recently flooded soil? The answer is: reaeration from the air at the water-atmosphere interface photosynthesis from algae and aquatic vegetation during the day In all cases, most of the oxygen needed for microbial aerobic respiration of our new flooded soil will have to travel the distance corresponding to the thickness of the water column, and, the linear distance within the porous medium of the soil, which can be quite tortuous. This property of the soil/sediment has been factored in by researchers and been called tortuosity. In summary, the supply of oxygen to bacteria in a flooded soil is limited because of four factors: there is about 30 times less \\(O_2\\) in water than there is in the same volume of air the \\(O_2\\) diffusive transport capacity in water is about 8,000 times smaller than that in air \\(O_2\\) has to travel from the atmosphere to the soil through the thickness of the water column, and travel through the tortuous path of the soil porous medium In addition to these four rules, which apply to all aquatic systems, the velocity of water matters very much in the reaeration process, which corresponds to factor 1 above: reaeration is much higher for streams than for stagnant waters (see Chapter 11). In other words, the stagnant water above our flooded wetland soil example, is another factor, compared to streams, which further limits the supply of oxygen to the aerobic bacteria in the flooded soil. This is developed at length in Chapter 13 of this book. Not surprisingly, this supply is just too limited compared to the demand. As a result, most of our recently flooded soil bacteria consumes all the \\(O_2\\) and the only part of the sediment that might have a little bit of oxygen is the area at the soil-water interface. This is what is illustrated in Figure 8.2 below. Figure 8.2: Animation summarizing the formation of aerobic and anaerobic layers of a theoretical flooded wetland soil due to the imbalance between bacterial respiratory oxygen demand and oxygen supply through the water column Because of the \\(O_2\\) demand in the sediment, an \\(O_2\\) concentration gradient forms from the soil-water interface down. This concentration gradient, in turn, drives a downward movement of oxygen from the water column into the sediment. Because the \\(O_2\\) demand exceeds the \\(O_2\\) that can be supplied because of all the limitations described above, there is a depth at which all the oxygen has been consumed above. This depth defines the beginning of the anaerobic zone of the sediment, and above it, the aerobic layer of the sediment. Now that we have explored what organic matter was in Chapter 4, it is important to recall that in all molecular families of the primary metabolites, and many of the secondary metabolites, the atoms of nitrogen and sulfur are assimilated always as fully reduced, that is that they have 8 electrons for themselves because they are bonded to carbon atoms. To be perfectly correct, there are few exemptions when \\(N\\) and \\(S\\) atoms are involved in functional groups called nitro, and sulfo (not mentioned in Chapter 3 because they are rare and anecdotic in nature) where they are bonded to oxygen atoms, in which case they have lost most if not all their electrons to oxygen. Another exception that needs to be cited is the disulfur bridge functional group very common in proteins, where two thiol groups interact together to form a \\(-S-S-\\) bond. In that case, each sulfur only has 7 electrons for itself. However, the sulfur atoms regain their electrons upon the disulfur bridge breakup thanks to electron donors. In all cases, during respirations (aerobic and anaerobic) the sulfur atoms will always appear as in thiol groups and as a result always appear to carry 8 electrons for themselves. We saw in Chapter 4 that the nitrogen atoms appeared in organic molecules as primary, secondary, and tertiary amines (details in section 3.2.4), but that in all cases, the nitrogen had all 8 electrons for itself. 8.3 Respiration in the anaerobic zone of the soil What happens to all the microbes in the anaerobic zone of the sediment? Certainly the exclusively aerobic microbes just do not survive, but most bacteria are facultative aerobs. In other words, they can switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration. Let us state this again: in the anaerobic zone of the sediment, only unicellular microorganisms are able to survive and have had to adapt their respiration to still be able to produce ATP for their metabolism, but using electron acceptors other than \\(O_2\\). It turns out that thermodynamics dictate that not all electron acceptors can generate the same amount of energy when they strip electrons from their electron donors. As a result, one can classify electron acceptors in decreasing order from the most to the least oxidizing, and the list of preferred electron acceptors goes as such: nitrate or \\(NO_3^-\\) Manganese oxide (\\(MnO_2\\)) or \\(Mn \\space (IV)\\) Iron oxides/hydroxyde or \\(Fe \\space (III)\\) sulfate or \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) Carbon dioxide or \\(CO_2\\) Although very different microbes are involved at the different stages, the apparent demand for electron acceptor, in our theoretical wetland soil, can be described as a temporal sequence of events: oxygen is the preferred electron acceptor; when \\(O_2\\) is all used, \\(NO_3^-\\) will be used as the preferred electron acceptor; when all the \\(NO_3^-\\) is used, the next most powerful electron acceptor is \\(MnO_2\\) (also referred to \\(Mn \\space (IV)\\); IV corresponds to its oxidation state), which is present in a solid or mineral form in soils; when all the \\(MnO_2\\) is used, then iron oxide or hydroxyde, which are also in the solid phase (also referred to \\(Fe \\space (III)\\), III corresponds to its oxidation state) will be used as the preferred electron acceptor; when all the \\(Fe\\) is used, then \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) is used as the next preferred electron acceptor, and then when finally all the other electron acceptors have been all used, \\(CO_2\\) can be the ultimate electron acceptor…! Finally, to this temporal sequence corresponds a theoretical spatial sequence or layers where each of the electron acceptor essentially defines a soil layer, with the layers organized with depth from the most to the least oxidizing electron acceptor as represented in Figure 8.3 Figure 8.3: Theoretical spatial layering of wetland soils corresponding to the electron acceptor available, not too long after flooding. In each layer, the oxidizing and the reduced forms are illustrated as oxidizing/reduced. Not to scale It is now time to present the respiration processes in each of the redox layer. 8.4 A denitrification layer below the aerobic layer The next most powerful or oxidizing electron acceptor after \\(O_2\\) is \\(NO_3^-\\). We have seen in the previous chapters that the N atom in nitrate has zero electron for itself, hence its ability to accept electrons. Just like for aerobic respiration, nitrate reduction just does not happen on its own. Facultative anaerobic bacteria called denitrifiers take advantage of the electrons available on organic matter and of nitrate to accept them to generate their energy. The denitrification of this theoretical wetland soil is referred to as heterotrophic denitrification because the source of carbon for these denitrifiers is also the source of electron, as OM is the source of both. The autolithotrophic denitrifiers, which use pyrite FeS2 as their source of electrons, are presented later in this chapter. There are two possible byproducts of nitrate reduction: N2, which is the inert gas that makes 78% of our atmosphere, and N2O, which is a potent greenhouse gas. The byproduct of the oxidation of OM are the same as the ones in aerobic heterotrophic respiration, i.e., \\(CO_2\\), NH4+, HS-, and PO43-. Figure 8.4: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic denitrification In reality, denitrification involves not a direct reduction of nitrate into N2 or N2O, but rather a sequence of reductions, summarized in equation (8.1), where nitrite, nitrogen monoxide, and nitrous oxides are intermediate products: \\[\\begin{equation} NO_3^- \\rightarrow NO_2^- \\rightarrow NO \\rightarrow N_2O \\rightarrow N_2 \\tag{8.1} \\end{equation}\\] Nitrous oxide is thus evidence of an incomplete denitrification. Because denitrification currently is the one mechanism, which removes nitrogen from the aqueous phase as gaseous byproduct, it currently ranks as the most effective ways to treat excess nitrogen in water. Entire research programs are dedicated to the development of methods and treatment systems to optimize this process. One of the active research areas is about finding ways to have denitrification go all the way to the N2 stage to minimize the production of N2O. Because this is a reduction process, and because nitrate is not assimilated in the denitrifier cells, a very short and good definition of denitrification is the microbially mediated dissimilatory reduction of nitrate into dinitrogen. The nitrogen atoms in the N2 molecule have 5 electrons for themselves. For complete denitrification, this means that the nitrogen atom has gained 5 electrons from \\(NO_3^-\\) to N~2. We will see in this chapter that it is possible to numerically show this in what is referred to as redox half reactions. A more complete and more descriptive definition of denitrification is Denitrification refers to the dissimilatory reduction, by essentially aerobic bacteria, of one or both of the ionic nitrogen oxides (nitrate, \\(NO_3^-\\), and nitrite, N\\(O_2\\)-) to the gaseous oxides (nitric oxide, NO, and nitrous oxide, N20), which may themselves be further reduced to dinitrogen (N2). The nitrogen oxides act as terminal electron acceptors in the absence of oxygen. The gaseous nitrogen species are major products of these reductive processes (Knowles 1982). The details of the electron transfer near the denitrifiers inner membrane are actually different (Figure 8.5) than those of aerobic respiration as illustrated in Figure ?? in this chapter. More proteins are involved, which descriptions are provided in Figure 8.5. The details of the denitrification of the electron transfer chain are beyond the purpose of this book. However, it is important to recognize that the electrons, originally stored on organic molecules, are brought to the membrane on the cytoplasm side by the electron transfer molecule NADH, just as is the case for aerobic respiration. It is also important to see that protons are pumped from the cytoplasm to the periplasm by ‘proton pumps’ such as cytochromes, and nitrate reductase powered by ubiquinone. Although the ATPase is not illustrated in Figure 8.5, the proton gradient formed in the periplasm does generate the proton motive force for the synthesis of ATP. In the end the electron transfer scheme of denitrication illustrated in Figure 8.4 holds, and sufficies for our purpose. Figure 8.5: Summary of Electron Transfer Chain for heterotrophic denitrification (after Su et al. (2015)). NAR: Nitrate reductase; NIR: nitrite reductase; NOR: nitric oxide reductace; N2OR: nitrous oxide reductase; UQ: ubiquinol; Fe-S: iron-sulfur protein; Cyt b, Cyt c: cytochrome b and c Denitrification is thought to be inhibited by the presence of oxygen, and thus only occurs in our theoretical wetland soil, below the aerobic layer. However, denitrification only occurs if there is nitrate present as electron acceptor. Therefore, for denitrification to proceed, there must be a supply of nitrate that can compensate the demand due to denitrification. The only place from where nitrate can be supplied, is the water column, and, possibly, the aerobic layer of the sediment where nitrification can take place, as we shall see later. Following the same analysis as that of aerobic respiration, the demand for nitrate creates a downward flux of nitrate from the water column down. Because of the transport distance for nitrate from the water column and through the aerobic layer of the sediment, the supply tends to be lower than the demand. This suggests that at one point in depth there will be no more nitrate as they are consumed faster than they can diffuse downward. Nitrates thus diffuse through layer 1, and both diffuse and are consumed as electron acceptors in layer 2 in Figure 8.3. Again, because the demand exceeds the supply, nitrates cannot move further down than the bottom of layer 2. Denitrification is thus theoretically restricted to layer 2. 8.5 Manganese and Iron oxides reductions Below the denitrification layer, microbes have to find new electron acceptors for their respiration. After \\(O_2\\), which is a gas, \\(NO_3^-\\), which is a dissolved anion, the next elements which serve as electron acceptors are solids: Manganese and Iron oxides. They will serve as electron acceptors, only if soil minerals containing \\(Mn\\) and \\(Fe\\) oxides are present. In our theoretical wetland soil, the assumption is that these oxides are present. In layer 3 (Figure 8.3), \\(MnO_2\\) serve as the electron acceptor. In the \\(MnO_2\\) minerals, the manganese is in the \\(Mn\\) (IV) form, and can accept up to 2 e- to become the mobile \\(Mn^{2+}\\) cation. The quantitative details of the transfer of electrons are given in in this chapter. Overall the Manganese reduction respiration scheme is illustrated in Figure 8.6. Figure 8.6: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic Manganese oxide reduction While the electron acceptor is immobile, the reduction of \\(MnO_2\\) produces \\(Mn^{2+}\\) ions, which are dissolved, mobile in water, and can diffuse following concentration gradients. In our original hypothesis of the sudden flooding of the wetland soil, \\(MnO_2\\) oxides would be reduced from layer 3 down. The \\(Mn^{2+}\\) ions produced in these layers, and the lack of \\(Mn^{2+}\\) ions in layers 1 and 2, would create a concentration gradient, which would generate an upward flux of \\(Mn^{2+}\\), this time, from layers 3 to 6 into layers 2 and 1. The fate of \\(Mn^{2+}\\) ions as they reach the aerobic layer is discussed below. The global significance of managenese reduction to carbon oxidation in aquatic sediments seems to be rather low (reviewed in Thamdrup 2000), and less than 10% of total benthic mineralization. The contribution of organotrophic \\(Mn\\) reduction is limited by the low \\(Mn\\) content with depletion of \\(Mn\\) oxides within the upper 1-2 cm of most sediments and by slow reaction kenetics relative to the competing inorganic reduction. In contrast to Mn, \\(Fe\\) reduction contributes significantly to carbon oxidation in many sediments (Thamdrup 2000). After the \\(MnO_2\\) oxides are reduced, the iron oxides and hydroxide minerals will similarly serve as electron acceptors following the general equation (??), and respiration scheme illustrated in Figure 8.7. The reduction of an iron hydroxide Fe(OH)3 has been added to show that in reality, \\(Fe^{3+}\\) never exists as such, but almost always as iron oxides or hydroxides. Many forms of iron oxides exist in soils, hence the choice of choosing iron hydroxide Fe(OH)3 in equation (??). \\(Fe^{3+}\\), Fe(OH)3, and other iron oxides are referred to as ferric iron or Fe(III), because their oxidation state is 3. Ferric iron generally has an orange rusty color. As \\(Fe^{3+}\\) is oxidized into \\(Fe^{2+}\\), it gains one electron. Figure 8.7: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic Iron oxide reduction The electron transfer chain for manganese has not been researched as much as that of Fe, although the latter still holds many unknowns. Many different proteins are involved, and may vary depending on the organisms. In a recent review, Bird et al. (2011) illustrate two identified pathways. The first one for Geobacter sulfurreducens (Figure 8.8) involves a suite of proteins referred to as Omp or Omc. The energy yield of the electron transfer seems rather low however. The extracellular location of the electron acceptor (Fe III) is energetically costly, particularly because the proton gradient between the periplasm and the cytoplasm is limited by the absence of proton consumption in the cytoplasm (as is the case for aerobic respiration when the electrons are accepted in the cytoplasm with the consumption of a proton along with it). Using any external electron acceptor thus costs the cell one proton per electron transferred. The second reason for low efficiency is that the electron transport chain is short. In the current model of electron transfer to Fe(III), no energy is harvested after the electrons reach the periplasm. The amount of energy extracted from the electron transport chain therefore depends not on the potential difference (DE) between NADH and the final acceptor, but on the DE between NADH and the periplasmic acceptor. […] s. It therefore seems that Geobacter has adapted to use low-potential substrates [e.g. Fe(III) minerals] rather than maintaining an electron transport chain that would allow it to extract greater energy from higher potential acceptors(Figure 8.8; Bird, Bonnefoy, and Newman (2011)).

Abbreviations: NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; cit, citrate.scheme for heterotrophic Iron oxide reduction. from (Bird, Bonnefoy, and Newman 2011) In their second illustration, Bird et al. (2011) show that Shewanella oneidensis does not use proton gradients and the ATPase to produce ATP, but rather uses substrate level phosphorylation to gain energy when reducing Fe(III). The hypothesis is that the oxidation of lactate to acetate is sufficient to produce ATP, and this substrate level phosphorylation can go on at the electron donated to NADH end up on \\(Fe\\) (III) (Figure 8.9). Figure 8.9: (a) Electron tranfer chain for the organotrophic reduction of ferric iron (Fe III) in Shewanella. MtrC and OmcA are thought to be donors to Fe(III). Whether they interact directly with solid Fe(III), chelated Fe(III), electron shuttles such as flavins, or all three is unclear. ATP generation takes place via substrate level phosphorylation.

Blue arrows denote the aerobic path electrons take to O2, red arrows denote the path to Fe(III), and yellow bars denote potential ranges. The potentials of NADH1, bc1, and aa1 are simplified for clarity; in reality, each of these protein complexes has multiple redox centers and a range of potentials.

Similarly to \\(Mn^{2+}\\) ions, \\(Fe^{2+}\\) ions, or ferrous iron, or Fe(II) is a dissolved iron which is mobile in water, and can diffuse following concentration gradients. For the same reasons explained above for \\(Mn^{2+}\\), an upward concentration gradient between zones 4 to 6 and layers 3 to 1 is going to appear and the \\(Fe^{2+}\\) ions will tend to diffuse upward through layers 3 and 2. The fate of \\(Fe^{2+}\\) ions as they reach the aerobic layer is discussed below. This vertical spatial sequence of layers 3 and 4 presented here probably only applies not too long after the theoretical wetland soil has been flooded. Indeed, over the long periods, the supply of ferric iron and manganese oxides will run out, as the only supply is in immobile mineral forms. So over long periods, layers 3 and 4 do not exist. Is the case of a net downward water infiltration, the \\(Fe^{2+}\\) and \\(Mn^{2+}\\) ions diffuse upward all the way into the aerobic layer, and accumulate there for reasons illustrated below. In the more likely case of small but real net downward flux of water, the dissolved ions will leach out of the soil profile. The consequences are that poorly drained soils then to leach out their iron and manganese, which is referred to as iron and manganese depletion. This is the reason for the grey color of hydric soils (Figure 8.10). Figure 8.10: Example of pale bluish gray redox depletions. Note the faint rusty orange concentration distributed throughout the soil matrix.

As we have seen before, the sulfur atom on \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) has zero electrons for itself and it therefore can accept electrons following redox half-reaction equation (??). Sulfate reducing bacteria reduce sulfate into sulfide (S2-) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), i.e., that the sulfur atom has gained 8 electrons. The respiration scheme below (Figure 8.11) suggests that Organic matter is generally the electron donor. Figure 8.11: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic sulfate reduction Recent reviews (Pereira et al. 2011; Barton, Fardeau, and Fauque 2014), suggest that more than one hundred compounds including H2, sugars, pyruvate, amino acids, mono- (lactate) and dicarboxylic acids (acetate), alcohols, NAD(P)H, and aromatic compounds are potential electron donors for Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB). The presence of H2, formate, and acetate in the list of potential donors is symptomatic of the low level of redox potential, as these are often associated with fermentation processes. There seems to be a large variety of electron transfer chains depending on the exact SRB, involving many additional enzymes and proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane (Figure 8.12). In the end, however, ATP is still largely produced following the proton motive force at the ATPase thanks to proton gradients maintained by proton pumps. Figure 8.12: Summary of all identifed electron transfers in Sulfate Reducing Bacteria, as reviewed in (Pereira et al. 2011). Observe the reduction of \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) to S2- in the left corner. Observe the ATP synthase to the right, and many sorts of proton pumps. Also observe several of the electron donors listed in the previous paragraphs. The exhaustive list of the abbreviations and correspondance can be found in (Pereira et al. 2011). Typical concentrations of sulfate in ground- and stream waters are between 1 and 10 mg \\(SO_4^{2-}\\)/L. In our theoretical wetland soil profile, sulfate that might be originally present in the porewater will be reduced in layers 5 and 6 of Figure 8.3. For the same reasons invoked for oxygen and nitrate, the potential source of supply for sulfate for the sulfate reducing layer is all the sulfate that might be present in the layers above and the water column. The demand for sulfate in layer 5 will create a downward concentration gradient which will generate a downward diffusive movement of sulfate down to layer 5. And again, because of all the diffusion distance, the supply of \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) is limited and does not match the demand. The imbalance between the sulfate supply and demand will limit the diffusion of sulfate to the bottom of layer 5, below which there will be no more sulfate. 8.7 The methanogenesis oddity The last redox reactions to take place at the bottom of our theoretical wetland soil uses \\(CO_2\\) as the electron acceptor. Interestingly, the generic organic matter is no longer the electron donor, but is replaced by two byproducts of fermentation processes: H2 and acetic acid CH3COOH as illustrated in Figure 8.13. Figure 8.13: Respiration scheme for the heterotrophic Carbon dioxide reduction or methanogenesis Because of the source of the electron donors, methanogens have to be physically located close to bacteria which metabolism is based on fermentation. In reality, in many cases “microbes interact via syntrophic associations, in which the metabolic by-products of one species serve as nutrients for another” (Hamilton, Calixto Contreras, and Reed 2015). And this is not only a property of methanogens (see below). The electron transfer chain of the methanogen bacterium Methanospirillum hungatei has been nicely illustrated by (Hamilton, Calixto Contreras, and Reed 2015) and is represented in Figure 8.14. Notice that ATP is, here again, synthesized by the proton motive force thanks to the proton gradient created by inverse flow of Na+. The latter is created thanks to sodium pumps powered by the oxidation of H2 (bottom right). The electrons lost from H2 are accepted onto \\(CO_2\\), which acts as the substrate, and the reduced carbon then becomes CH4, which is excreted out of the cell. Figure 8.14: Summary of the Electron Transfer Chain for the methanogen bacterium Methanospirillum hungatei, which uses H2 as its electron donor. The exhaustive list of the abbreviations and correspondance can be found in supplementary information of (Hamilton, Calixto Contreras, and Reed 2015) 8.8 Fermentation in wetland and stream sediment In reality, the redox chain presented above and in most textbooks avoids several important additional electron transfer mechanisms, because the latter tend to ‘muddy the water’ a bit on the otherwise clear theoretical description. The first of these is fermentation. In the previous chapter, we saw that the whole respiration process starts with glycolysis, which produces pyruvate The fermentation products are beyond the scope of this class so, we will not come back to that, but it is important to recognize that H2 and CH3COOH can donate electrons as shown in these half-reactions: 8.9 First summary on the electron acceptor chain in wetland soils except for methanogenesis, organic matter always serves, for organotrophs, as the electron donor. Moreover, it is exclusively the Carbon of the OM which provides the electrons. as a result, the byproducts of the oxidation of the OM when the organic carbons lose their electrons are always the same: \\(CO_2\\), NH4+, H2S/HS-, and PO43- (but for methanogenesis). This means that at one point, all of these four (five if one counts both H2S and HS-, their exact proportion depends on pH, see details in the glossary) molecules will accumulate where they are produced unless they are used by another process To the contrary, the byproducts of the reduction of the electron acceptors are variable and depend on the electron acceptor. In the case of incomplete denitrification, and in the case of methanogenesis, N2O and CH4 are significant greenhouse gases. 8.10 Supply and demand of electron acceptors and of the byproducts of Organic Matter oxidation Now that we have established the reduction processes of the different electron acceptors at play, let us look at the consequences of the demands and the supplies associated with the respiratory processes. 8.10.1 Demands drive downward fluxes of dioxygen, nitrate and sulfate In the Figure 8.15 below, the general directions of the fluxes of electrons acceptors and byproducts of respiration are illustrated for our theoretical wetland soil. The processes taken together is sometimes referred to as soil or sediment diagenesis and all the processes in there are then collectively referred to as diagenetic processes. Figure 8.15: Diffusion fluxes of electron acceptors and all other soil diagenesis processes of a theoretical layered wetland soil The demands for dioxygen, nitrate, and sulfate in their respective layers, lower their concentrations compared to the overlying water and layers, hence the formation of concentration gradients, which then drive downward diffusive fluxes of these electron acceptors to their respective layers. These fluxes are represented as downward arrows in Figure 8.15. Now, it is the imbalance between the supply from above and the demand from below, that explain why the downward diffusion does not go beyond the bottom of the respective layers 1, 2, and 5 in Figure 8.15. The limitation of supply has been described for dioxygen in section ??. The diffusivity, distance, and tortuosity of the soil pores also apply for nitrate and sulfate, and explain why the demand is generally not met by the supply. 8.10.2 Supply of byproducts of organic matter oxidation For every respiration process described above (except for methanogenesis), the byproducts are: \\(CO_2\\), NH4+, H2S/HS-, and PO43-. This suggests that in every single layer, there is a supply of all for of these byproducts. Inevitably, this will create an upward concentration gradient, which will then be followed by an upward flux of these four molecules in the sediment. Phosphate will thus dissolve upward, at least until it reaches the aerobic layer. There it might encounter soil mineral oxides where it might bind, as we shall see in future chapters, hence the tips of the arrows not reaching the soil-water interface. However, it is possible that, if the aerobic layer is very thin and the mineral oxides are scarce in this thin layer, phosphates may diffuse all the way into the water column, hence the dotted arrow. 8.10.3 Nitrification Similarly, because of ammonium production in all the layers, but that of methanogenesis, ammonium will diffuse upward, until it reaches the aerobic layer. Remember that the nitrogen atom on the ammonium carries 8 electrons for itself, so it potentially carries a lot of energy. And yes, you guessed right, microbes called nitrifiers take advantage of these electrons and use ammonium as their electron donors, and use \\(O_2\\) as their electron acceptor. Because the electron donor this time is not an organic molecule, nitrifiers are called lithotrophs. Nitrification is represented in Figure 8.15 as the horizontal white arrow to the left. The nitrification respiration schemes is summarized in Figure 8.16. Figure 8.16: Respiration scheme for nitrification Depending on the thickness of the aerobic layer and the availability of dioxygen, all or only a portion of the ammonium may get nitrified as ammonium moves upward, hence the dotted arrow going all the way to the water column. As nitrate is now produced in the aerobic layer of the soil, then the concentration gradient may sway upward or remain downward, depending on the nitrate concentration in the water column, hence the upward nitrate dotted arrow in Figure 8.15. You may also notice that a dotted white arrow pointing the left has been added to illustrate nitrification which tends to readily occur in the water column, often thanks to nitrifiers attached at the soil-water interface. In reality nitrification involves two stages: the oxidation of ammonium into nitrite, performed by ammonium oxidizing bacteria, of which two important genera are Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococcus, and then the oxidation of nitrite into nitrate, performed by Nitrobacter and Nitrospira bacteria (Equation (8.2)). But as far as we are concerned, both steps tend to occur almost simultaneously, and nitrite is thermodynamically unstable, and as a result very little tends to accumulate, either in soil or sediment. \\[\\begin{equation} NH_4^+ \\rightarrow NO_2^- \\rightarrow NO_3^- \\tag{8.2} \\end{equation}\\] Work in progress Denitrification chain image here. By Uswbios - https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=24910639 8.10.4 Gas bubble formation Among the last two OM oxidation byproducts, \\(CO_2\\) and H2S are gases. We saw earlier, that in reality the balance between H2S and HS- depends on the pH. In rather organic soils, which most treatment wetland soils are, the pH tends to be rather acidic, often below 6.5. So it is fair to represent the H2S/HS- couple as H2S rather than HS- (see H2S/HS- Figure), hence the choice of H2S in Figure 8.15 and the use of H2S below. So in the end, if the summation of partial pressure of these and all other dissolved gases exceeds 1 atm + the hydraulic head, gas bubble will form and migrate upward. But because of surface tension forces, gas bubbles tend to get rather easily trapped in wetland soils and sediment. Hence the release of wetland gases when somebody or something disturbs the sediment, as we have seen in lab. To these two gases, one should add the production of CH4 in the methanogenesis layer, which will readily ‘join’ the gas bubbles and the ride with them. The dissolved fraction will also tend to move upward because of the concentration gradient. Interestingly, methane does not oxidized very well in normal aerobic conditions of wetland soils, and will therefore tend to diffuse all the way up to the water column as illustrated in Figure 8.15. Because of the demand for \\(CO_2\\) in the methanogenesis layer, downward arrows have been added for layers 4 and 5 in Figure 8.15. The downward diffusion would only apply for the dissolved \\(CO_2\\) as the gaseous form would obviously tend to move upward. 8.10.5 Oxidation of upward moving reduced sulfur Similarly to ammonium, and although a good proportion of H2S will end up in the gas phase, a still significant amount will stay in solution and will diffuse upward until it reaches the aerobic layer. Very similarly to ammonium, H2S still carries 8 electrons, which can be used for respiration provided that a strong enough oxidizer be present. In the aerobic layer of the sediment, H2S will be oxidized back into sulfate following the respiration scheme in Figure 8.17 Figure 8.17: Respiration scheme for hydrogen sulfide oxidation The bacteria taking advantage of the electrons on sulfur of H2S are called sulfur oxidizing bacteria. There are different from the sulfur reducing bacteria which use OM as their electron donors, and sulfate as their electron acceptors. The oxidation of H2S has been summarized by the white horizontal arrow in both the aerobic layer of the soil and the water column. Sulfate produced can then diffuse back downward to layer 5 in Figure 8.15. 8.10.6 Oxidation of upward moving \\(Mn^{2+}\\) and \\(Fe^{2+}\\) The last direct reduction byproducts of respiration processes include \\(Mn^{2+}\\) and \\(Fe^{2+}\\). Because they are being produced in layers 3 and below, an upward concentration gradient will be created, followed by an upward movement of \\(Mn^{2+}\\) and \\(Fe^{2+}\\). In Figure 8.15, both of them have been represented as starting to move up from layers 4. In all logic, \\(Mn^{2+}\\) and Fe2 should start moving upward as low as layer 6 because our original hypothesis was that soil was suddenly flooded, so in the temporal sequence of electron acceptors, before sulfate carbon dioxide reduction conditions would prevail in Layers 5 and 6, respectively, the \\(Mn\\) and \\(Fe\\) oxides will serve as electron acceptors, and \\(Mn^{2+}\\) and \\(Fe^{2+}\\) will then be produced. The more important fact is the fate of both \\(Mn^{2+}\\) and \\(Fe^{2+}\\) as they reach the aerobic layer. Because they are both reduced, they potentially have one electron to give, and yes, some bacteria have specialized in the ability to oxidize these ions. These bacteria are referred to as manganese and iron oxidizing bacteria. The respiration scheme corresponding to iron oxidation is illustrated in Figure 8.18 below. Figure 8.18: Respiration scheme for iron oxidation As both \\(Mn^{2+}\\) and \\(Fe^{2+}\\) get oxidized in the aerobic layer of the sediment, they form \\(Mn\\) and \\(Fe\\) oxides, which are solids and precipitates with the other soil minerals, hence the underlying and downward pointing arrows under the \\(MnO_2\\) and \\(Fe^{3+}\\) in Figure 8.15. The precipitation of iron oxides or hydroxides can be quite visually spectacular sometimes as reduced groundwater seeps out into the open. Iron can get very quickly oxidized and form rusty biofilms. Figure 8.19: Picture of an ‘iron seep’ in Goldsboro, NC, as reduced groundwater gets oxidized in contact with air 8.10.7 Moving of Dissolved Organic Carbon The last but not least of the processes at play in diagenesis is the formation and diffusion of Dissolved Organic Carbon in poorly or anoxic soils. This is the subject of a future chapter. This concludes this long chapter on the importance respiration processes occurring in wetland soils.

The concentration of any constituent in water is determined by the dynamic equilibrium between supply and demand rates. The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) does not escape this simple rule. 10.1.1 The supply and demand of O2 in water The equilibrium between atmospheric O2 and that in the aqueous phase is discussed in details in this chapter. At this point, it is only important to understand that the activities, used in the chemistry sense here, are the same for elements in different phases at equilibrium. As a result, at equilibrium, there is O2 dissolved in water and the amount dissolved depends, in conditions where there is no demand, mainly on the temperature and on the velocity of water. The colder the water, the higher the concentrations, and the warmer the water, the smaller the concentrations. For example, at 5°C one can calculate that the equilibrium concentration is 12.8 mg/L, while at 20°C, it is 9.2 mg/L. We will see in this chapter that the reaeration of water, i.e., the kinetics at which O2 can dissolved into water depends on its turbulence: at low velocity, the reaeration is low, and at high velocity it is high. Additionally, the rate of supply of O2 to water may be affected by photosynthesis, which creates an endogenous additional source. The demand of oxygen in water comes from all aerobic respiratory processes existing in the water column itself (e.g., mineralization, nitrification, etc.) plus those existing in the bottom substrate. The final DO concentration results from the equilibrium between the supply and demand rates. When the potential for supply is much higher (e.g., swift cold stream) than the potential for demand, the DO concentrations are high (e.g., &gt; 6 mg/L). To the contrary, when the potential for supply is low (e.g., stagnant warm wetland water) and the potential for demand high (e.g., the same warm organic rich wetland), the DO concentrations will equilibrate at low concentrations (e.g., &lt; 2 mg/L). In the end, the level of concentration of DO, does determine the level of activity of aerobic respiratory processes in streams, which has consequences on the concentration levels of important inorganic and organic elements. 10.2 Level of nutrient concentrations in natural undisturbed streams This chapter is still under construction "],["acidbase.html", "Chapter 11 Applied thermochemistry: acid-base equilibria 11.1 The Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory 11.2 Acid-base equilibrium parameters 11.3 Self-ionization of water 11.4 Strong vs. weak acids 11.5 Mono- and polyprotic acids mole fractions 11.6 Equilibrium calculations using a graphical method", " Chapter 11 Applied thermochemistry: acid-base equilibria Chapter summary: An acid is a molecule which can donate a hydrogen ion H+ and a base is an element that can accept a H+ The level of pH dictates which of the conjugate acid and base forms are preponderant in a solution Reversely, pH is also dependent upon the concentrations of elements in a solution Graphical methods are very useful methods to visualize concentrations and to calculate pH The differences in orders of magnitude in concentrations allow to make very useful approximations in chemistry to calculate preponderant concentrations as well as the pH of solutions 11.1 The Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory According to the Brønsted-Lowry theory, an acid is any species that is capable of donating a hydrogen ion H+, and a base is any species capable of accepting a hydrogen ion, which requires a lone pair of electrons to bond to the H+ (Wikipedia_contributors2018-fr?). An acid necessarily contains an atom of hydrogen. The two forms exchanging a hydrogen ion a referred to as conjugate acid and base. Technically, a proton or hydrogen ion cannot exist unhydrated in water solution. And technically, in water, a hydrogen ion is hydrated to produce the hydronium ion: \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O + hydrogen \\space ion \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_0 \\tag{11.1} \\end{equation}\\] So technically, donating a hydrogen ion for an acid necessarily involves the molecule of water as in the equilibrium (11.2) \\[\\begin{equation} acid + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ + conjugate \\: base \\hspace{2.5cm} K_1 \\tag{11.2} \\end{equation}\\] One can dissociate, however this reaction in two elementary reactions as \\[\\begin{equation} acid \\rightleftharpoons hydrogen \\space ion + conjugate \\: base \\hspace{2.5cm} K_2 \\\\ H_2O + hydrogen \\space ion \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_0 \\tag{11.3} \\end{equation}\\] Because the activity of water is essentially constant in dilute aqueous solutions, the hydration of the hydrogen ion can be ignored in defining acid-base equilibria (Stumm and Morgan 1996). The thermodynamic convention sets the standard free energy change ΔG° for reaction (11.1) equal to zero, or its rate constant K0=1. So from now on, the molecule of water is purposely omitted in acid-base reactions herein, and the hydrated hydrogen ion is written as H+. In the equilibrium (11.4) below, the acid is represented as HA. It can donate a hydrogen ion H+. The anion A- is referred to as the conjugate base. \\[\\begin{equation} HA \\rightleftharpoons A^- + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_A \\tag{11.4} \\end{equation}\\] Another example of an acid, is illustrated in equilibrium (11.5) where the acid is an anion (cation in the generic example below), and the conjugate base is an uncharged molecule. \\[\\begin{equation} HA^+ \\rightleftharpoons A + H^+ \\tag{11.5} \\end{equation}\\] Some molecules can be both an acid and a base: they are referred to as being amphoteric. Water is the most famous amphoteric molecule as it can donate a hydrogen ion to yield a hydroxide OH-, or gain an electron to form the hydronium cation H3O+ as illustrated in equilibria (11.6) \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O \\rightleftharpoons OH^- + H^+ \\\\ H_2O + H^+ \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ \\tag{11.6} \\end{equation}\\] By convention, however, the acid conjugate is always placed on the left of the equilibria, and the conjugate base and the hydrogen ion H+ are placed on the right side of the equilibrium. 11.2 Acid-base equilibrium parameters 11.2.1 KA Like for all chemical reactions, it is possible to write down the equilibrium constant as the product of the activities of the products divided by the product of the activities of the reactants as in equation (11.7): \\[\\begin{equation} K_A = \\frac{\\{A^-\\}\\{H^+\\}}{\\{HA\\}} \\tag{11.7} \\end{equation}\\] where the activity of HA is written as \\(\\{HA\\}\\). For natural waters, a very good approximation of an element chemical activities is its concentration and the expression of KA can be expressed as in equation (11.8): \\[\\begin{equation} K_A = \\frac{[A^-][H^+]}{[HA]} \\tag{11.8} \\end{equation}\\] where, e.g., the concentration of HA can be written as \\([HA]\\). 11.2.2 pKA When the concentration of both conjugate acids and bases are equal in a solution, the expression of KA in equation (11.8) is simplified into \\[\\begin{equation} K_A = [H^+] \\tag{11.9} \\end{equation}\\] Taking the negative of the common logarithm (base 10) on both side yields: \\[\\begin{equation} -log(K_A) = -log \\left([H^+]\\right) \\tag{11.10} \\end{equation}\\] The right side of equation (11.10) is the definition of the pH. By analogy, one can define a new term \\[\\begin{equation} pK_A = -log(K_A) \\tag{11.11} \\end{equation}\\] which corresponds to the pH value at which the concentrations of the conjugate acid and base are equal. 11.3 Self-ionization of water In all aqueous solutions, the following reaction (11.12), referred to as the autoprotolysis must be considered: \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons OH^- + H_3O^+ \\tag{11.12} \\end{equation}\\] Since in dilute solution the activity of water \\({ \\{H_2O \\} = 1}\\) the equilibrium constant for equilibrium (11.12), often referred to as the ‘ion product’ or ‘ionic product’ of water can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} K_w = \\{OH^-\\} \\{H_3O^+\\} \\equiv \\{OH^-\\} \\{H^+\\} \\tag{11.13} \\end{equation}\\] According to Stumm and Morgan (1996), at 25°C, Kw = 1.008 × 10-14 and the pH = 7.00 corresponds to the exact neutrality in pure water ([H+] = [OH-]) Technically, Kw changes with temperature, according to equation (11.14) (Harned and Owen 1958) \\[\\begin{equation} log K_w = \\frac{-4470.99}{T} + 6.0875 - 0.01706 T \\tag{11.14} \\end{equation}\\] With temperatures T expressed in °K. One can see in Figure 11.1 that the pH at exact neutrality varies with T°C reaching 7.37 at 5°C and decreasing down to about 6.84 at 35°C. So contrary to the common understanding that pH at neutrality is equal to 7, it actually changes with temperature, and not on an insignificant way. This is a reason why it is preferrable to calibrate pH probes using pH buffer solutions in the lab near 25°C. For all calculation purposes in this chapter, we will assume that the temperature is at 25°C, and we can therefore take that pH=7 at neutrality and that log Kw=-14. Figure 11.1: Kw and pH at exact neutrality as a function of T°C 11.4 Strong vs. weak acids The concept of ionization of water defines the limits within which water activity remains equal to one, while the hydroxyde OH- and hydronium H3O+ or simpler hydrogen ion H+ coexist. At pH=0, all the ionization is in the form of H+, and conversely, at pH=14, all the autoprololysis of water yields only OH-. Beyond these limits, i.e., pH less than 0 and greater than 14, one cannot consider these dilute solutions in water anymore. So all acids for which the pKA (i.e., -log(KA)) is beyond the 0 to 14 values, are considered strong acids or strong bases. This means that in dilute solutions, the acid (or the base) can be considered entirely dissociated into its conjugate base (or acid). To better understand this, let us take nitric acid for which the pKA=-1.4. This means that there is as much HNO3 as there is NO3- at pH=-1.4. So for dilute solutions, we can consider that all HNO3 has been dissociated into NO3-, and that in fact there is no measurable HNO3 in solution. Conversely, all other acids for which the pKA is within 0 and 14 are considered weak acids, because depending on the pH, they can either be in the HA or A- forms, if we take our generic equilibrium example (11.4). It turns out that many inorganic nutrients of interest and all organic acids are weak acids. This property makes them undergo transformations depending on the controlling pH, but also makes them play a very significant role in buffering the ambient pH. These weak acids are in large part responsible for the relative narrow range of pH in natural waters included in most cases between 4.5 and 8.5. 11.5 Mono- and polyprotic acids mole fractions The first equilibrium (11.4) illustrates the case of a monoprotic acid, i.e., that can donate only one hydrogen ion. For our purposes, important monoprotic acids include \\(HSO_4^{2-}\\) and \\(NH_4^+\\). Among the inorganic nutrients important to environmental and ecological engineering, several are polyprotic acids, namely, phosphates, carbonates, and hydrogen sulfides. Polyprotic acids are acids that can donate more than one hydrogen ion. Because they have the ability to donate or gain a hydrogen ion, these polyprotic acids, with other species, play a very special role in buffering the pH of streams, ground, lake, and sea waters, as well as that of soil pore water. The mono- and polyprotic acids mentioned above can take several forms, depending on the pH. Reversely, some of the biogeochemical processes at play, e.g., in streams or a wetland soil, will tend to add or remove some of the conjugate forms, possibly modifying the local pH over time. An important tool to understand the role played by environmentally important weak acids is to calculate the relative molar fraction of each of the conjugate forms as a function of pH. In the following, we will illustrate how to calculate the molar fraction for an example triprotic acid, as well as in the general case of an acid able to donate n hydrogen ions. Results of the general case apply to the monoprotic acids as well. 11.5.1 Triprotic acid example Let us take a generic triprotic acid able to donate up to three hydrogen ions. Three equilibrium reactions coexist in solution, in addition to the autoprotolysis of water (11.15). Before we start the calculations of the molar fractions, let us establish some simple methodological rules that greatly help solve many of chemistry problems. Always: Write all the reaction equilibria at play and the corresponding equilibrium constants list all the ionic and the non-ionic forms at play Establish the electroneutrality of the solution by balancing the positive and negative charges of the ions at play Establish the conservation of mass when possible Equilibria at play: \\[\\begin{equation} H_3A \\rightleftharpoons H_2A^- + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_1 = \\frac{[H_2A^-][H^+]}{[H_3A]}\\\\ H_2A^- \\rightleftharpoons HA^{2-} + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_2 = \\frac{[H_2A^-][H^+]}{[HA^{2-}]}\\\\ HA^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons A^{3-} + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_3 = \\frac{[HA^{2-}][H^+]}{[A^{3-}]}\\\\ H_2O \\rightleftharpoons OH^- + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_w = [H^+][OH^-] \\tag{11.15} \\end{equation}\\] List of the ionic forms: cations: \\(H^+\\) anions: \\(H_2A^-\\), \\(HA^{2-}\\), \\(A^{3-}\\), \\(OH^-\\) all other forms: \\(H_3A\\), \\(H_2O\\) Electroneutrality of the solution: \\([H^+] = [H_2A^-] + 2\\times[HA^{2-}] + 3\\times[A^{3-}] + [OH^-]\\) The factor 2 before \\(2\\times[HA^{2-}]\\) expresses the relative contribution of the concentration \\([HA^{2-}]\\) to the total negative charge. The same is true for \\(3\\times[A^{3-}]\\). Conservation of mass: The summation of all the conjugate forms is often referred to as ‘total concentration’ or \\(C_T\\) \\(C_T = [H_3A] + [H_2A^-] + [HA^{2-}] + [A^{3-}]\\) After establishing the constraints of the system, it is possible to evaluate the relative abundance of each of the conjugate forms, i.e., the molar fraction or the ratio between concentrations of each form and \\(C_T\\), the total concentration of all the forms. To get there, let us first express each of the conjugate forms as a function of \\([H_3A]\\). Using the equations for the reaction constants, and combining the expressions of \\(K_1\\), \\(K_2\\), and \\(K_3\\) from (11.15), it is possible to obtain: \\[\\begin{equation} [H_2A^-] = [H_3A] \\frac{K_1}{[H^+]} \\\\ [HA^{2-}] = [H_3A] \\frac{K_1K_2}{[H^+]^2} \\\\ [A^{3-}] = [H_3A] \\frac{K_1K_2K_3}{[H^+]^3} \\\\ \\tag{11.16} \\end{equation}\\] Replacing the expressions of each conjugate forms in (11.16) above, the equation of the conservation of mass then becomes: \\[\\begin{equation} C_T = [H_3A] \\times \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_1}{[H^+]} + \\frac{K_1K_2}{[H^+]^2} + \\frac{K_1K_2K_3}{[H^+]^3}\\right) \\tag{11.17} \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} C_T = [H_3A] \\times \\left( \\frac{[H^+]^3 + K_1[H^+]^2 + K_1K_2[H^+] + K_1K_2K_3}{[H^+]^3}\\right) \\tag{11.18} \\end{equation}\\] The molar fraction \\(\\alpha_0\\) of the fully hydrogen ionated acid can be expressed as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha_0 = \\frac{[H_3A]}{C_T} \\tag{11.19} \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha_0 = \\frac{[H^+]^3}{[H^+]^3 + K_1[H^+]^2 + K_1K_2[H^+] + K_1K_2K_3} \\tag{11.20} \\end{equation}\\] By analogy, and using the reaction constant equations, the other molar fractions can be expressed as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha_1 = \\frac{[H_2A^-]}{C_T} = \\frac{K_1[H^+]^2}{[H^+]^3 + K_1[H^+]^2 + K_1K_2[H^+] + K_1K_2K_3} \\tag{11.21} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha_2 = \\frac{[HA^{2-}]}{C_T} = \\frac{K_1K_2[H^+]}{[H^+]^3 + K_1[H^+]^2 + K_1K_2[H^+] + K_1K_2K_3} \\tag{11.22} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha_3 = \\frac{[A^{3-}]}{C_T} = \\frac{K_1K_2K_3}{[H^+]^3 + K_1[H^+]^2 + K_1K_2[H^+] + K_1K_2K_3} \\tag{11.23} \\end{equation}\\] Notice that for all molar fractions, the denominator does not change, only the numerator does. 11.5.2 Generalized polyprotic acid mole fractions The example above can be used to draw the general case of a polyprotic acid which can donate n hydrogen ions (including for n = 1). Using the same methodology as before : Equilibria at play: \\[\\begin{equation} H_nA \\rightleftharpoons H_{n-1}A^- + H^+ \\hspace{0.6cm} K_{a1} = \\frac{[H_{n-1}A^-][H^+]}{[H_nA]} \\hspace{0.6cm} [H_{n-1}A^-] = [H_nA] \\frac {K_{a1}}{[H^+]}\\\\ H_{n-1}A^- \\rightleftharpoons H_{n-2}A^{2-} + H^+ \\hspace{0.6cm} K_{a2} = \\frac{[H_{n-2}A^{2-}][H^+]}{[H_{n-1}A]} \\hspace{0.6cm} [H_{n-2}A^-] = [H_nA] \\frac {K_{a1}K_{a2}}{[H^+]^2}\\\\ \\\\ \\vdots \\hspace{6cm} \\vdots \\hspace{6cm} \\vdots\\\\ \\\\ HA^{(n-1)-} \\rightleftharpoons A^{n-} + H^+ \\hspace{0.6cm} K_{an} = \\frac{[A^{n-}][H^+]}{[HA^{(n-1)-}]} \\hspace{0.6cm} [A^{n-}] = [H_nA] \\frac {K_{a1}K_{a2} \\ldots K_{an}}{[H^+]^n}\\\\ \\tag{11.24} \\end{equation}\\] List of the ionic forms: cations: \\(H^+\\) anions: \\(H_{n-1}A^-\\), \\(H_{n-2}A^{2-}\\), … , \\(A^{n-}\\), \\(OH^-\\) all other forms: \\(H_nA\\), \\(H_2O\\) Electroneutrality of the solution: \\([H^+] = [H_{n-1}A^-] + 2\\times[H_{n-2}A^{2-}] \\space + \\space ... \\space + \\space n\\times[A^{n-}] + [OH^-]\\) Conservation of mass: The summation of all the conjugate forms is often referred to as ‘total concentration’ or \\(C_T\\) \\(C_T = [H_nA] + [H_{n-1}A^-] + ... + [A^{n-}]\\) The generalized equation for the mole fraction \\(i\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha_i = \\frac{[H_{n-i}A^{(n-i)-}]}{C_T} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\alpha_i = \\frac{K_{a1}K_{a2} \\ldots K_{ai}[H^+]^{n-i}}{[H^+]^n + K_{a1}[H^+]^{n-1} + K_1K_2[H^+]^{n-2} + \\dots + K_{a1}K_{a2}\\dots K_{an}} \\tag{11.25} \\end{equation}\\] 11.5.3 Graphical illustration of mole fractions of ecologically relevant weak acids 11.5.3.1 Mole fraction for ammonium/ammonia Now that we have defined the expressions for the molar fraction of weak acids, it is time to apply the generalized equation (11.25) to ecologically relevant weak acids. Let us start with ammonium \\(NH_4^+\\) and its conjugate base \\(NH_3\\). At 25°C, the pKA is 9.28, or at pH = 9.28, \\([NH_4^+] = [NH_3]\\). At pH less than pKA, \\(NH_4^+\\) is the preponderant form, and at pH greater than pKA, \\(NH_3\\) becomes the preponderant form. One can see in Figure 11.2, that at pH less than 8, the molar fraction of ammonia is less than 5% of the total \\([NH_4^+] + [NH_3]\\) (sometimes referred to as Total Amoniacal Nitrogen, or TAN). For this reason, in most natural waters, \\([NH_4^+]\\) is by far the most preponderant form. Because in most natural waters, the concentrations of \\(NH_4^+\\) is relatively low (~&lt; 0.2 mg N/L), there is very little loss of ammonia through volatilization. However, in animal waste water such as hog lagoons as they exist in North Carolina, ammonia volatilization is important. The pH of these lagoons range from 6.5 to 8.5 for an average of 7.8 (Barker, Zublena, and Walls 1994), yielding 3% of the TAN as ammonia. However, the total TAN concentration can easily reach 1000 to 2000 mg N/L, resulting in \\([NH_3]\\) between 30 and 60 mg N/L. The potential for ammonia volatilization is thus very high and occurs despite low molar fractions. Figure 11.2: Molar fraction for ammonium and ammonia in dilute solutions at 25°C Now, technically an important piece of information should have been added for the ammonium/ammonia molar fraction graph. Because ammonia is a gas that can equilibrate with the atmosphere, and is therefore an open system, the graph illustrated in Figure 11.2 corresponds to the case of a ‘closed system’, and in particular a system not directly open to the atmosphere. In reality, because of the pH range in natural waters, and the fact that ammonium is by far the most preponderant form, even when open to the atmosphere, the ammonium/ammonia equilibrium behaves very much like a closed system, in the case of low total ammoniacal concentrations. 11.5.3.2 Mole fraction for phosphate and its conjugated acids The phosphate anion (\\(PO_4^{3-}\\)) has three conjugate acids, and is the dehydrogen ionated form of the triprotic phosphoric acid. The pKA of the conjugate forms are at 25°C 2.12, 7.21, and 12.67. The preponderant forms present at pH between 4.5 and 8.5 are thus dihydrogen (\\(H_2PO_4^-\\)) and hydrogen (\\(HPO_4^{2-}\\)) phosphates (Figure 11.3). The byproduct of microbial respiration that finds its way into natural waters is thus rarely if ever \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) unlike presented in Chapter 8… The \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) form is still commonly used as a generic ‘phosphate’ molecule, regardless of pH considerations. Figure 11.3: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the triprotic phosphoric acid in dilute solutions at 25°C 11.5.3.3 Mole fraction for sulfate and hydrogen sulfate In most natural waters with pH between 4.5 and 8.5, sulfate is the preponderant form, and in the vast majority of cases, there is very little \\(HSO_4^-\\) (Figure 11.4). This figure also suggests that sulfuric acid (\\(H_2SO_4^{2-}\\)) does not exist in dilute waters in this form. Figure 11.4: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the hydrogen sulfate and sulfate in dilute solutions at 25°C 11.5.3.4 Mole fraction of dissolved dihydrogen sulfide and conjugate bases Now, for dihydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide/carbonic acid, the volatile forms are present in very significant amounts for pH of natural waters. Because the molar fraction equation (11.25) only applies in closed systems, one might suggest that natural systems are in fact open systems, such that equation (11.25) just should not be used. True for open waters. However, there are lots of other ‘captive’ waters such as groundwater or sediment porewater, that are not directly open to the atmosphere and for which it is possible to use the molar fraction equation (11.25). The pKa of the dihydrogen sulfide/hydrogen sulfide is 7.02 at 25°C, and there is still about 10% of \\(H_2S_(aq)\\) at pH=8 (Figure 11.5). The sulfide ion \\(S^{2-}\\), for most natural waters is not present and for the normal range of pH of natural waters, the two significant forms are \\(H_2S_(aq)\\) and \\(HS^-\\). There are consequences on bubble formation or gas ebullition in aquatic sediments as we shall see herein. Figure 11.5: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the hydrogen sulfide in dilute solutions at 25°C 11.5.3.5 Mole fraction of hydrated carbon dioxide and carbonates Similarly to the hydrogen sulfide diprotic acid, carbon dioxide in water can become hydrated and becomes the diprotic carbonic acid, which can donate up to two electrons. For the normal range of pH of natural waters, the two significant forms are \\(H_2CO_3^o\\) and \\(HCO_3^-\\) (Figure 11.6), where \\[\\begin{equation} \\{H_2CO_3^o\\} = \\{CO_{2(aq)}\\} + \\{H_2CO_3\\}\\\\ \\tag{11.26} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 11.6: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the hydrated carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, and carbonate in dilute solutions at 25°C The reason for combining \\(CO_{2(aq)}\\) and the true carbonic acid \\(H_2CO_3\\) into one composite \\(H_2CO_3^o\\) is to make apparent the diprotic nature of the carbonate system, i.e., it makes the protolysis of \\(H_2CO_3^o\\) more apparent considering the three species \\(H_2CO_3^o\\), \\(HCO_3^{-}\\), and \\(CO_3^{2-}\\) as in the equilibria below (equation (11.27)): \\[\\begin{equation} H_2CO_3^o \\rightleftharpoons HCO_3^- + H^+ \\\\ HCO_3^- \\rightleftharpoons CO_3^{2-} + H^+ \\tag{11.27} \\end{equation}\\] But why not using carbonic acid proper (\\(H_2CO_3\\)) rather than this composite \\(H_2CO_3^o\\)? It is because the hydration of dissolved carbon dioxide into carbonic acid (equation (11.28)) occurs but the equilibrium is skewed towards the left with less than 0.3% of the carbon dioxide hydrated into \\([H_2CO_3]\\) (equilibrium constant K - equation (11.28) - values range from 350 to 990, with 650 commonly used (Stumm and Morgan 1996)). \\[\\begin{equation} CO_{2(aq)} + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons H_2CO_3 \\hspace{3.5cm} K = \\frac{\\{CO_{2(aq)}\\}}{\\{H_2CO_3\\}}\\\\ \\tag{11.28} \\end{equation}\\] The composite \\(H_2CO_3^o\\) is thus a notation to remind student chemists that in reality, there is relatively little carbonic acid in solution, and although \\(CO_{2(aq)}\\) would better represent the actual species in water, protolysis is only apparent from a hydrated \\(CO_{2(aq)}\\). One might wonder then how \\(CO_{2(aq)}\\) dissociates into \\(HCO_3^{-}\\)… It does not, the true carbonic acid \\(H_2CO_3\\) is the one that undergoes protolysis (i.e., the release of a hydrogen ion). The kinetics of the series of reactions illustrated in equation (11.29) show that the limiting reaction is the hydration of the \\(CO_{2(aq)}\\) into \\(H_2CO_3\\), but that the overall effective hydration equilibrium from \\(CO_{2(aq)}\\) into \\(HCO_3^-\\) takes no more than a few minutes to establish (Stumm and Morgan 1996). \\[\\begin{equation} CO_{2(aq)} + H_2O \\hspace{0.5cm} \\underset{fast}{\\stackrel{slow}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\hspace{0.5cm} H_2CO_3 \\underset{}{\\stackrel{very fast}{\\rightleftharpoons}} H^+ + HCO_3^{-} \\\\ \\tag{11.29} \\end{equation}\\] Several byproducts of respiratory processes are gases: \\(CO_2\\), \\(N_2\\), \\(N_2O\\), \\(H_2S\\) and \\(CH_4\\). One of the consequences on wetland sediment porewater chemistry, is that the pH being relatively acidic, most of the inorganic sulfur and carbon byproduct of respiration are in the \\(H_2S_{(aq)}\\) form and \\(CO_{2(aq)}\\), rather than in their conjugate bases. For a given dissolved gas concentration, there corresponds, at equilibrium, an equivalent partial pressure in the gas phase above that water. The two are related by the Henry’s law (Henry and Banks 1803) that essentially says that the quantity of an ideal gas that dissolves in a definite volume of liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas above it. This applying to all gases that might be dissolved in water (list above plus \\(O_2\\) although not in anaerobic sediment) such that one can add all the corresponding partial pressures of all the gases. If the summation of the partial pressures of all the dissolved gases becomes greater than one atmosphere plus the height of the water column above, then the solubility of all the gases is exceeded, and gas bubbles form (more details in chapter 13 dedicated to dissolved gases). 11.5.3.6 Mole fraction of common polyprotic organic acids Many weak acids are involved at the cellular level and participate in buffering the solution into which the organelles “bathe” in cells. These include di- and triprotic acids. Oxalic (Figure 11.7), malonic, succinic, and fumaric acids are C2, C3, and C4 diprotic acids with carboxyl groups located on the outer carbons. Figure 11.7: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the diprotic oxalic acid in dilute solutions at 25°C Base conjugates are usually the preponderant forms at intracellular pH (7-7.4), so malonic (Figure 11.8), succinic (Figure 11.9), and fumaric (Figure 11.10) acids are thus usually referred to as malate, succinate, and fumarate, which are all involved in the citric acid cycle. Figure 11.8: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the triprotic citric acid in dilute solutions at 25°C Figure 11.9: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the triprotic citric acid in dilute solutions at 25°C Figure 11.10: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the triprotic citric acid in dilute solutions at 25°C In the last step of the citric acid, the oxalo-acetate (Figure 5.28) incorporates an acetate to form the triprotic citric acid (Figure 11.11), the molecule at the center of the citric acid cycle. All these acids do not seem to be able to provide that much buffering capacity for intracellular pH as they are all in their most basic conjugate form. However at pH 7, 20% of the citrate is in the AH2- form. Figure 11.11: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the triprotic citric acid in dilute solutions at 25°C Another interesting example of a potential triprotic acid is uric acid (Figure 11.12). Actually, it is somewhat surprising that it would behave as an acid at all, as it does not contain any carboxylic acid. However, the hydroxyl of the imidazol moeity does lose a hydrogen ion, but the other hydroxyl groups do not. In reality, uric acid does not behave like a polyprotic acid, but as a monoprotic acid… Figure 11.12: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the diprotic uric acid in dilute solutions at 25°C Uric acid is a product of the metabolic breakdown of purine nucleotides, and is normally found in urine. Uric acid further decomposes in urea and a C3 molecule. The curious in you will write the Lewis dot structure and realize that the carbon in urea has zero electrons for itself, and so is the case for two of the carbons on uric acid, although it is an organic molecule! This means that all the energy has been squeezed out, which is not too surprising for a molecule that essentially is a waste product. 11.6 Equilibrium calculations using a graphical method The graphical representation of the molar fraction highlights well the clear preponderant form for a given pH range, and the relative percentage of several forms for other pH values. Molar fractions are also independent of the total concentration. When the molar fractions are less than 1%, this method gives little graphical information on the relative abundance of the forms at play as the lines overlap each other. Because the variation of pH represents variations of orders of magnitude in the hydrated hydrogen ion concentrations, the concentrations of conjugate forms can vary by orders of magnitude as a function of pH. The representation of the \\(log(conc) = f(pH)\\) opens the opportunity to graphically represent concentrations as a function of pH. As it turns out, this method can then be used to calculate pH values of a solution that would have been made from the addition of a salt. 11.6.1 Logarithm of concentrations as a function of pH For this, let us first consider the theoretical salt AHCl added to one liter of water, which fully dissociates into \\(AH^+ + Cl^-\\), with \\(AH^+\\) being a weak acid. The goal of this exercise is to be able to graphically represent \\(log(conc) = f(pH)\\) for both conjugate forms \\(AH^+\\) and \\(A\\). For this, let us use the systematic method previously presented. Equilibria at play: \\[\\begin{equation} AH^+ \\rightleftharpoons A + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_A = \\frac{[A][H^+]}{[AH^+]}\\\\ \\tag{11.30} \\end{equation}\\] List of the ionic forms: cations: \\(H^+\\), \\(AH^+\\) anions: \\(OH^-\\), \\(Cl^-\\) all other forms: \\(A\\), \\(H_2O\\) Electroneutrality of the solution: \\([H^+] + [AH^+] = [Cl^-] + [OH^-]\\) Conservation of mass: \\(C_T = [AH^+] + [A]\\) Using the conservation of mass equation, one can write: \\[\\begin{equation} C_T = [AH^+] \\times \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_A}{[H^+]} \\right) \\tag{11.31} \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} C_T = [AH^+] \\times \\left( \\frac{K_A + [H^+]}{[H^+]} \\right) \\tag{11.32} \\end{equation}\\] This yields to the expression of both \\([AH^+]\\) and \\([A]\\): \\[\\begin{equation} [AH^+] = \\frac{C_T. [H^+]}{K_A + [H^+]} \\\\ [A] = \\frac{C_T. K_A}{K_A + [H^+]} \\tag{11.33} \\end{equation}\\] The denominator of the expressions of \\([AH^+]\\) and \\([A]\\) is a summation, which does not go very well with the use of logarithms. Using XXIst century technology, this really is not a problem and one can plot \\(log(conc) = f(pH)\\) with ease. But at the time when people were using slide rules, this was not so easy. The point is not to go back in time, but rather reflect on what it is that these expressions are telling and this involves the understanding of the physical meaning of what the equations represent. Again, the goal here is to get a better representation of how the concentrations change as a function of pH. In the denominator \\(K_A + [H^+]\\), the \\([H^+]\\) varies on a logarithm scale as pH increases since \\([H^+] = 10^{-pH}\\). As a result, \\([H^+]\\) can increase or decrease very rapidly as a function of pH. The denominator can thus but dominated by either \\(K_A\\) or \\([H^+]\\). This means that in some cases, the summation in the denominator might be simplified by one of the two terms. The next step consists in defining for what pH values these conditions would be met. Case number 1: \\([H^+] \\gg K_A\\) For chemists, such a condition is traditionally approximated when \\(K_A &gt; 10 \\times [H^+]\\). A series of equations ensues: \\[\\begin{equation} [H^+] &gt; 10 \\times K_A \\\\ log([H^+]) &gt; log(10) + log(K_A) \\\\ -log([H^+]) &lt; -log(10) - log(K_A) \\\\ \\tag{11.34} \\end{equation}\\] or when \\[\\begin{equation} pH &lt; pK_A - 1 \\tag{11.35} \\end{equation}\\] So in this case, one can simplify the expressions of \\([AH^+]\\) and \\([A]\\) by: \\[\\begin{equation} [AH^+] \\approx C_T \\hspace{3.5cm} [A] \\approx \\frac{C_T. K_A}{[H^+]} \\\\ \\tag{11.36} \\end{equation}\\] Case number 2: \\(K_A \\gg [H^+]\\) This condition is approximated when \\(K_A &gt; 10 \\times [H^+]\\). A series of equations ensues: \\[\\begin{equation} K_A &gt; 10 \\times [H^+] \\\\ log(K_A) &gt; log(10) + log([H^+]) \\\\ - log(K_A) &lt; -1 - log([H^+]) \\\\ \\tag{11.37} \\end{equation}\\] or when \\[\\begin{equation} pH &gt; pK_A + 1 \\tag{11.38} \\end{equation}\\] So in this case, one can simplify the expressions of \\([AH^+]\\) and \\([A]\\) by: \\[\\begin{equation} [AH^+] \\approx \\frac{C_T. [H^+]}{K_A} \\hspace{3.5cm} [A] \\approx C_T \\\\ \\tag{11.39} \\end{equation}\\] Case number 3: \\([AH^+]=[A]\\) When the \\([AH^+]\\) and \\([A]\\) are equal, one can write: \\[\\begin{equation} C_T = 2 \\times [AH^+] \\\\ [AH^+]=[A]= \\frac{C_T}{2}\\\\ \\tag{11.40} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} K_A = [H^+] \\\\ pH = pK_A \\tag{11.41} \\end{equation}\\] Let us now summarize these findings and calculate the \\(log(conc) = f(pH)\\) in table 11.1. The expressions of \\(log[AH^+]\\) and \\(log[A]\\) have been purposely left as \\(C^{st} - pH\\) and \\(C^{st} + pH\\), respectively, with \\(C^{st}\\) standing for a constant value. This is to emphasize that one does not need to numerically calculate the value of the constants, as one has all needed information to make a robust graphical representation of \\(log(conc) = f(pH)\\). Table 11.1: Summary of the expressions and approximated expressions of \\(conc\\), and \\(log(conc)\\) for a monoprotic acid as a function of pH for \\(H^+\\), \\(OH^-\\), \\(AH^+\\), and \\(A\\) pH &lt; pKA - 1 pH = pKA pH &gt; pKA + 1 \\([H^+]\\) \\(10^{-pH}\\) \\(10^{-pH}\\) \\(10^{-pH}\\) \\([OH^-]\\) \\(10^{-14+pH}\\) \\(10^{-14+pH}\\) \\(10^{-14+pH}\\) \\([AH^+]\\) \\(C_T\\) \\(\\frac{C_T}{2}\\) \\(\\frac{C_T . [H^+]}{K_A}\\) \\([A]\\) \\(\\frac{C_T . K_A}{[H^+]}\\) \\(\\frac{C_T}{2}\\) \\(C_T\\) \\(log[H^+]\\) \\(-pH\\) \\(-pH\\) \\(-pH\\) \\(log[OH^-]\\) \\(-14+pH\\) \\(-14+pH\\) \\(-14+pH\\) \\(log[AH^+]\\) \\(log(C_T)\\) \\(log(C_T) - log(2)\\) \\(C^{st} - pH\\) \\(log[A]\\) \\(C^{st} + pH\\) \\(log(C_T) - log(2)\\) \\(log(C_T)\\) The expressions show that for \\(pH&lt;pK_A-1\\) and \\(pH&gt;pK_A+1\\), \\(log[AH^+]\\) and \\(log[A]\\) follow straight lines of slope -1, 0, or +1 as a function of pH. It is thus possible to draw linear asymptotic lines, litterally, which the \\(log[AH^+]\\) and \\(log[A]\\) lines should follow for \\(pH&lt;pK_A-1\\) and \\(pH&gt;pK_A+1\\). The actual \\(log[AH^+]\\) and \\(log[A]\\) lines would then deviate from the asymptotic lines for \\(pK_A-1&lt;pH&lt;pK_A+1\\) and crossing at \\(logC_T - 0.3\\) at \\(pH=pK_A\\). An example graph of \\(log(conc) = f(pH)\\) is provided in Figure 11.13. This is generally referred to at the Bjerrum plot. The lines \\(log[H^+] = -pH\\) and \\(log[OH^-] = -14+pH\\) are first plotted (in grey in Figure 11.13). The next step is to draw the asymptotic lines (dotted lines in Figure 11.13). These appear as straight lines as a function of pH as their equations indicate (Table 11.1). In reality, it is possible to extend these lines up to pH=pKA. Indeed asymptotic lines both intersect at \\(log[AH^+]=C_T\\) and \\(log[A]=C_T\\) at \\(pH=pK_A\\) (Figure 11.13). To draw these asymptotic lines, one needs to find this intersection and then draw either horizontal lines or lines with slopes of -1 or +1 as applicable. This is the reason why one does not need to know the numerical values of the \\(C^{st}\\) (constant) in the equations in Table 11.1. In reality, drawing the \\(log[H^+]\\) and \\(log[OH^-]\\) curves follows the same procedure. These two lines must meet at \\(log(conc)=-7\\) at \\(pH=7\\), and have slopes of -1 and +1, respectively. Figure 11.13: Forms of a hypothetical monoprotic acid for total concentration of 10{-3.2}M as a function of pH at 25°C The next step consists in superimposing the \\(log[AH^+]\\) and \\(log[A]\\) curves on the asymptotic lines outside of the \\(pK_A \\pm 1\\) area. The next step consists in drawing the point where the two curves \\(log[AH^+]\\) and \\(log[A]\\) meet at \\(pH=pK_A\\), i.e., at \\(log(C_T)-0.3\\). Then one would manually connect the \\(log[AH^+]\\) and \\(log[A]\\) curves through the \\(log(C_T)-0.3\\) at \\(pH=pK_A\\) point, such as the tangent of the curves at \\(pH=pK_A-1\\) and \\(pH=pK_A+1\\) match the linear portions outside of the \\(pK_A \\pm 1\\) area. Obviously for this book, the manual drawing of this curve cannot be achieved and the actual \\(log(conc) = f(pH)\\) have been plotted for \\([AH^+]\\) and \\([A]\\). One can observe that the actual curve apparently deviates from the asymptotic lines curves not at \\(pK_A \\pm 1\\) but rather at \\(pK_A \\pm 1.4\\). 11.6.2 Graphical approach to calculate pH for a monoprotic acid The graphical approach illustrated in Figure 11.13 gives a nice way to quickly see whether some ion concentrations are much smaller than other, and whether one can assume some forms to be negligible compared to others. So in the example above, combining the electroneutrality equation to that of the conversion of mass, and realizing that \\([Cl^-]=C_T\\) yields: \\[\\begin{equation} [H^+] + [AH^+] = [Cl^-] + [OH^-] \\\\ [H^+] + [AH^+] = [AH^+] + [A] + [OH^-] \\\\ [H^+] = [A] + [OH^-] \\tag{11.42} \\end{equation}\\] So now, this is where it is important to be able to assess the physical reality of the \\([A] + [OH^-]\\) summation. It is easy to visualize on Figure 11.13 the relative importance of \\([A]\\) vs \\([OH^-]\\). In the figure, and for \\(pH&lt;pK_A\\), \\([OH^-] \\leq 10^{-5} [A]\\). One can safely assume that \\([A] + [OH^-] \\approx [A]\\). Hence, in these cases, \\([H^+] \\approx [A]\\), which means that pH can be graphically determined at the intersection between the \\(log[H^+]\\) and \\(log[A]\\) lines (Figure 11.14). The conditions for this graphical determination are that the \\(log[A]\\) curve be in its linear portion and that at the intersection, \\([A]&gt;10[OH^-]\\). Figure 11.14 is an interactive graph where one can rapidly graphically determine pH as a function of variable \\(pK_A\\) and \\(C_T\\). Figure 11.14: Graphical determination of pH as a function of variable pKA and CT for a hypothetical AHCl weak acid salt added into solution. Also available at this link Now, the graphs in Figures 11.13 and 11.14 were derived for an \\(AHCl\\) hypothetical salt fully dissociating into \\(AH^+\\), \\(A\\) and \\(Cl^-\\). An analogous analysis can be derived for a weak base salt of formula \\(ANa\\) which would fully dissociate into \\(HA\\), \\(A^-\\) and \\(Na^+\\). In this case, the combination of the electroneutrality and conservation of mass would yield \\([H^+] + [HA] = [OH^-]\\). Using the same reasoning as before, pH can be graphically determined at the intersection between the \\(log[OH^-]\\) and \\(log[HA]\\) lines, and provided that the \\(log[HA]\\) curve be in its linear portion and that at the intersection \\([HA]&gt;10[H^+]\\). Figure 11.15: Graphical determination of pH as a function of variable pKA and CT for a hypothetical ANa weak base salt added into solution Notice that when a hypothetical \\(AHCl\\) salt is added to solution, the pH tends to be acidic, and reversely, when a \\(ANa\\) salt is added, the pH tends to be basic. This is expected as the salts fully dissociate into, \\(AH^+\\) and \\(Cl^-\\), and \\(A^-\\) and \\(Na^+\\), in the first and second cases, respectively. In the first case, the initial form is thus the acid conjugate form \\(AH^+\\) which is first in solution, and that later dissociates into its conjugate base, thus releasing \\(H^+\\) and hence lowering the pH. In the second case, the conjugate base \\(A^-\\) is released in water first and consumes \\(H^+\\) to form its conjugate acid \\(HA\\), hence increasing the pH. 11.6.3 Graphical approach to calculate pH for a triprotic acid Following the same procedure as that presented for a monoprotic acid, there are interesting points to highlight when plotting \\(log(conc)=f(pH)\\) for a triprotic acid. It turns out that phosphate triprotic base has a particular relevance for ecological engineering, so it is interesting to use phosphate as an illustration on how to derive \\(log(conc) = f(pH)\\) and graphically calculate pH for polyprotic acid/bases. Equation (11.17) derived above for a triprotic acid is: \\[\\begin{equation} C_T = [H_3A] \\times \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_1}{[H^+]} + \\frac{K_1K_2}{[H^+]^2} + \\frac{K_1K_2K_3}{[H^+]^3}\\right) \\tag{11.17} \\end{equation}\\] For a monoprotic acid, the last two terms to the right did not exist, and it was relatively easy to express \\([AH^+]\\) and \\([A]\\) as in equation (11.33): \\[\\begin{equation} [AH^+] = \\frac{C_T. [H^+]}{K_A + [H^+]} \\\\ [A] = \\frac{C_T. K_A}{K_A + [H^+]} \\tag{11.33} \\end{equation}\\] and then find the conditions for which the denominator could be simplified when \\(K_A \\gg [H^+]\\) or \\([H^+] \\gg K_A\\). But with the two extra terms in (11.17), this cannot be done as easily. The solution to this problem is, again, to realize the relative importance of the different terms in (11.17) and make simplifications and approximations that are amply sufficient to obtain robust graphical representations of the \\(log(conc)=f(pH)\\). Indeed, one can make the hypothesis that for pH near pK1, \\([H_3A]\\) and \\([H_2A^-]\\) are by far the most prepoderant forms, such that the conservation of mass equation: \\[\\begin{equation} C_T = [H_3A] + [H_2A^-] + [HA^{2-}] + [A^{3-}] \\tag{11.43} \\end{equation}\\] can be approximated into \\[\\begin{equation} C_T \\approx [H_3A] + [H_2A^-] \\tag{11.44} \\end{equation}\\] This is now a familiar problem which has already been solved for a monoprotic acid, for \\(pH &lt; pK_1 - 1\\) and for \\(pH &gt; pK_1 + 1\\) (Table 11.1). For example, for \\(pH &lt; pK_1 - 1\\) and by analogy to results summarized in Table 11.1, all concentrations can be approximated by: \\[\\begin{equation} [H_3A] \\approx C_T \\\\ [H_2A^-] \\approx \\frac{C_T.K_1}{[H^+]} \\\\ [HA^{2-}] \\approx \\frac{C_T.K_1.K_2}{[H^+]^2} \\\\ [A^{3-}] \\approx \\frac{C_T.K_1.K_2.K_3}{[H^+]^3} \\tag{11.45} \\end{equation}\\] Obviously, the conservation of mass equation can be simplified the same way for pH near pK2, where \\([H_2A^-]\\) and \\([HA^{2-}]\\) can be hypothesized to be largely preponderant, and similarly for pH near pK3, where \\([HA^{2-}]\\) and \\([A^{3-}]\\) can be hypothesized to be preponderant. In the end, it is possible, for given pH ranges outside of the \\(pK_x \\pm 1\\) to simplify the equations of each of the conjugate acid forms, and the expression of \\(log(conc)=f(pH)\\). For a triprotic acid, this is summarized in Table 11.2 below. Table 11.2: Summary of the expressions and approximated expressions of \\(conc\\), and \\(log(conc)\\) for a triprotic acid as a function of pH for \\(H^+\\), \\(OH^-\\), \\([H_3A]\\), \\([H_2A^-]\\), \\([HA^{2-}]\\), and \\([A^{3-}]\\) pH &lt; pK1-1 pK1+1&lt; pH &lt; pK2-1 pK2+1&lt; pH &lt; pK3-1 pH &gt; pK3+1 \\([H^+]\\) \\(10^{-pH}\\) \\(10^{-pH}\\) \\(10^{-pH}\\) \\(10^{-pH}\\) \\([OH^-]\\) \\(10^{-14+pH}\\) \\(10^{-14+pH}\\) \\(10^{-14+pH}\\) \\(10^{-14+pH}\\) \\([H_3A]\\) \\(C_T\\) \\(\\frac{C_T.[H^+]}{K_1}\\) \\(\\frac{C_T.[H^+]^2}{K_1.K_2}\\) \\(\\frac{C_T.[H^+]^3}{K_1.K_2.K_3}\\) \\([H_2A^-]\\) \\(\\frac{C_T.K_1}{[H^+]}\\) \\(C_T\\) \\(\\frac{C_T.[H^+]}{K_2}\\) \\(\\frac{C_T.[H^+]^2}{K_2.K_3}\\) \\([HA^{2-}]\\) \\(\\frac{C_T.K_1.K_2}{[H^+]^2}\\) \\(\\frac{C_T.K_2}{[H^+]}\\) \\(C_T\\) \\(\\frac{C_T.[H^+]}{K_3}\\) \\([A^{3-}]\\) \\(\\frac{C_T.K_1.K_2.K_3}{[H^+]^3}\\) \\(\\frac{C_T.K_2.K_3}{[H^+]^2}\\) \\(\\frac{C_T.K_3}{[H^+]}\\) \\(C_T\\) \\(log[H^+]\\) \\(-pH\\) \\(-pH\\) \\(-pH\\) \\(-pH\\) \\(log[OH^-]\\) \\(-14+pH\\) \\(-14+pH\\) \\(-14+pH\\) \\(-14+pH\\) \\(log[H_3A]\\) \\(log(C_T)\\) \\(C^{st} - pH\\) \\(C^{st} - 2pH\\) \\(C^{st} - 3pH\\) \\(log[H_2A^-]\\) \\(C^{st} + pH\\) \\(log(C_T)\\) \\(C^{st} - pH\\) \\(C^{st} - 2pH\\) \\(log[HA^{2-}]\\) \\(C^{st} + 2pH\\) \\(C^{st} + pH\\) \\(log(C_T)\\) \\(C^{st} - pH\\) \\(log[A^{3-}]\\) \\(C^{st} + 3pH\\) \\(C^{st} + 2pH\\) \\(C^{st} + pH\\) \\(log(C_T)\\) Similarly to the case for monoprotic acids, the equations for the \\(log(conc)=f(pH)\\) in Table 11.2 are sometimes truncated into, e.g., \\(C^{st} + pH\\), \\(C^{st}\\) meaning ‘constant’. The reason for this is that these equations correspond to the equations of the straight lines that serve as asymptotic lines for the actual \\(log(conc)\\) curves. For sections with the slopes of ±1, these straight lines intersect at \\(pK_x\\). To draw the straight lines with the slopes of ±2, one may consider two facts: the linear sections with the slopes of ±2 intersect at \\(\\frac{pK_x+ pK_{x+1}}{2}\\) for \\(log(conc) = log(C_T)\\) for x=1 and x=2 (not shown in Figure 11.16 for clarity reasons), or, the sections with the slopes of ±2 intersect the linear sections with the slopes ±1 at \\(pK_x\\) (shown in Figure 11.16). It is thus possible to draw all these asymptotic lines as illustrated in Figure 11.16 below for the conjugate acids of phosphate \\(PO_4^{3-}\\). Following the principles described in section 11.6.2 above, the \\(log(conc)\\) curves follow the asymptotic lines outside the \\(pH=pK_x \\pm 1\\). The actual curves illustrated in Figure 11.16 actually deviate from the asymptotic lines for \\(pH=pK_x \\pm 1.4\\) as already observed in Figure 11.13. Again, this is of minor importance to graphically determine the pH of a solution. One can also verify that for pH near pKx, there are two preponderant forms, and that other forms are at least 105 times lower, which justifies the approach used to simplify the equation of conservation of mass (equation (11.43)) to only two terms (e.g., equation (11.44)). Notice that the curves for the equations \\(C^{st} \\pm 3pH\\) are off the chart and do not appear on Figure 11.16. Figure 11.16: Forms of polyprotic phosphoric acid for total concentration of 10-3.2M as a function of pH at 25°C. pK1=2.12; pK2=7.21; pK3=12.37 With this graph in hand, and for \\(C_T = 10^{-3.2}M\\) as illustrated in Figure 11.16, it becomes possible to graphically evaluate the pH of a solution in which a weak acid salt, e.g., \\(NaH_2PO_4\\), or a weak base salt, e.g., \\(CaHPO_4\\) would be added in solution for a final \\(C_T = 10^{-3.2}M\\). In the case of the \\(NaH_2PO_4\\) salt added, combining the electroneutrality and conservation of mass equations would yield: \\[\\begin{equation} [H_3PO_4] + [H^+] = [HPO_4^{2-}] + 2 [PO_4^{3-}] + [OH^-] \\tag{11.46} \\end{equation}\\] One can seen on Figure 11.16 that for this \\(C_T\\), \\([H_3PO_4] &lt; 10[H^+]\\), and \\(2 [PO_4^{3-}] + [OH^-] \\ll [HPO_4^{2-}]\\), such that equation (11.46) can be approximated as \\([H^+] \\approx [HPO_4^{2-}]\\). This means that the pH would correspond to that of the intersection between the \\(log[H^+]\\) and \\(log[HPO_4^{2-}]\\) lines. In the case of \\(CaHPO_4\\) salt added, combining the electroneutrality and conservation of mass equations would yield: \\[\\begin{equation} 2[H_3PO_4] + [H_2PO_4^-] + [H^+] = [PO_4^{3-}] + [OH^-] \\tag{11.47} \\end{equation}\\] One can seen on Figure 11.16 that for this \\(C_T\\), \\(2[H_3PO_4] + [H^+] \\ll [H_2PO_4^-]\\), and that \\([PO_4^{3-}] \\ll [OH^-]\\), such that equation (11.47) can be approximated as \\([H_2PO_4^-] \\approx [OH^-]\\). This means that in this case the pH would correspond to that of the intersection between the \\(log[H_2PO_4^-]\\) and \\(log[OH^-]\\) lines. Such pH determinations can be done for a variety of \\(C_T\\) values corresponding to the addition of the weak acid \\(NaH_2PO_4\\) salt, and to the addition of the weak base salt \\(CaHPO_4\\). Several conditions must be met, including that the simplifications described above apply, and that the curves cross on their linear portions. An illustration of the possibilities, or not, of graphically determining the pH is provided in Figure 11.17. Figure 11.17: Graphical determination of pH as a function of variable CT when the weak acid salt \\(NaH_2PO_4\\), and when the weak base salt \\(CaHPO_4\\) are added into solution 11.6.4 Dissolved CO2 and carbonates in a closed system Before this chapter, \\(CO_2\\) has been treated in this book as the waste product of respiration, and the entry level of the conversion of photonic energy into chemical energy. Carbon dioxide has additional major roles: in this chapter, we will introduce its impact on pH of surface and sediment waters. There are four major ideas for which the equilibria involving \\(CO_2\\) and the carbonates matters: Because all organotrophic respiratory processes produce \\(CO_2\\) as a waste product (see sections 8.2; summary Figure 8.15), the potential to have dissolved \\(CO_2\\) in surface and sediment water is high. \\(CO_2\\) is a very soluble gas that readily dissolves in water (details in chapter 13; summary Figure 13.4). Dissolved carbon dioxide reacts with water to theoretically form carbonic acid. However, the equilibrium is balanced towards \\(CO_2\\) rather than \\(H_2CO_3\\), and there is little actual carbonic acid in water. Its ability to release hydrogen ions (\\(H^+\\)) is not affected, however, and \\(CO_2\\) practically participate in releasing \\(H^+\\) and can be viewed as a diprotic acid (details in section 11.5.3.5 above). Carbonate (\\(CO_3^{2-}\\)) reacts with cations such as \\(Ca^{2+}\\), \\(Mg^{2+}\\), \\(Na^{+}\\), \\(K^+\\), and \\(Fe^{2+}\\) to form carbonate rocks and minerals. Upon dissolution, these solids may add the conjugate base of the diprotic carbonic acid to the overall equilibria, and thus play a role in the pH of water. In the case of a closed system, such as would be the case for sediment porewater, one may apply the general equations and concepts described above to the dissolved \\(CO_2\\) and carbonate equilibria. In section 11.5.3.5, we saw that in reality the hydration of \\(CO_{2(aq)}\\) into carbonic acid \\(H_2CO_3\\) is slow such that about 0.3% of \\(CO_2\\) gets hydrated into carbonic acid (Stumm and Morgan 1996). Howver, the deprotonation of carbonic acid is rather efficient (see equation (11.29)), such that it is customary to introduce the conceptual \\(H_2CO_3^o\\), which behaves like a diprotic acid: \\[\\begin{equation} \\{H_2CO_3^o\\} = \\{CO_{2(aq)}\\} + \\{H_2CO_3\\}\\\\ \\tag{11.26} \\end{equation}\\] Equilibria at play: \\[\\begin{equation} H_2CO_3^o \\rightleftharpoons HCO_3^- + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_{a1} = \\frac{[HCO_3^-][H^+]}{[H_2CO_3^o]}\\\\ HCO_3^- \\rightleftharpoons CO_3^{2-} + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_{a2} = \\frac{[CO_3^{2-}][H^+]}{[HCO_3^-]}\\\\ H_2O \\rightleftharpoons OH^- + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_{w} = [OH^-][H^+] \\tag{11.48} \\end{equation}\\] List of the chemical forms at play: cations: \\(H^+\\) anions: \\(OH^-\\), \\(HCO_3^-\\), \\(CO_3^{2-}\\) all other forms: \\(H_2CO_3^o\\), \\(H_2O\\) Electroneutrality of the solution: \\([H^+] = 2 \\times [CO_3^{2-}] + [HCO_3^-] + [OH^-]\\) Conservation of mass (closed system): \\(DIC = [H_2CO_3^o] + [HCO_3^-] + [CO_3^{2-}]\\) In the case of carbonates and carbon dioxide, the \\(C_T\\) term previously used and standing for ‘total concentration’ is appropriately replaced by the term Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), as noted above. Remember that in \\(DIC = [CO_{2(aq)}] + [H_2CO_3] + [HCO_3^-] + [CO_3^{2-}]\\). Applying the general terms derived in Table 11.2, the approximate terms for \\([H_2CO_3^o]\\), \\([HCO_3^-]\\), and \\([CO_3^{2-}]\\) can be expressed as a function of pH, DIC, \\(K_{a1}\\), and \\(K_{a2}\\) in Table 11.3 below.

We have seen in section 8.4 the general concept of denitrification. In organotrophic denitrification (denitrication can be lithothophic), it is the nitrogen atom of nitrate that accepts electrons from the carbon atoms of organic matter. In other words, the nitrate, under anaerobic conditions, oxidizes organic matter into \\(CO_2\\) and \\(H_2O\\), while the nitrogen atom is reduced into \\(N_2\\) and \\(N_2O\\), both of which are gases. Let us make sure all this is clear. Again, let us use our favorite electron allocation tool to visualize where the electrons are, what atom can accept or donate electrons, and where electrons are transferred. In organotrophic respiration, the electrons are originally stored onto organic matter. Traditionally (e.g., Stumm and Morgan 1996) organic matter is simplified as \\(CH_2O\\) because only the carbon atoms participate in electron transfer, while the nitrogen and the sulfur atoms do not and stay reduced with 8 electrons for themselves. In organic chemistry, \\(CH_2O\\) corresponds to methanal, commonly called formalhehyde (Table 3.4). However, \\(CH_2O\\) in our case represents the ‘average’ behavior or carbon when it enters the respiratory chain (details in Chapter 5), and where 4 electrons are stored on the carbon. It turns out that in formaldehyde (\\(CH_2O\\)), carbon also has 4 electrons stored on carbon, so things are consistent. However, we prefer the representation of the ‘generic organic carbon’ as a secondary alcohol group (more properly expressed as \\(-CHOH-\\), although we will use \\(CH_2O\\) as a simplified and accepted notation), with 4 electrons on the carbon atom (Figure 12.1. On \\(CH_2O\\) the oxygen atom has 8 electrons for itself, but again, this energy is unavailalble because once oxygen has its 8 electrons, it will not donate them; details in Chapter 2). In other words, available electrons are the ones stored on the carbon atom of \\(CH_2O\\) in Figure 12.1. Figure 12.1: Electrons allocation on the carbon atoms showing 4 electrons stored on \\(CH_2O\\), surrogate for organic matter, and showing zero electrons on \\(CO_2\\); on the nitrogen atoms showing 0 electrons on \\(NO_3^-\\) and 5 electrons on \\(N_2\\); in all the molecules, including water, the oxygen always has 8 electrons for itself, and, being the most electronegative atom, does not participate in any electron transfer So why, can nitrate accept electrons from organic matter? On the nitrate molecule, the oxygen atoms have stripped all the electrons from the nitrogen atom, and as a result, the nitrogen atom has zero electrons for itself (Figure 12.1). It can accept electrons, and only be an electron acceptor, and not a donor because it has nothing to give. Because the oxygen atoms on the nitrate molecules have all 8 electrons for themselves, cannot donate them or receive any additional ones, the oxygen atoms on nitrate DO NOT participate in the transfer of electrons during denitrification. On a redox reaction side, the reduction of nitrate into dinitrogen involves the \\(NO_3^-/N_2\\) redox couple and can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} 2NO_3^- + 12 H^+ + 10 e^- \\rightleftharpoons N_2 + 6H_2O \\tag{12.1} \\end{equation}\\] One can see in reaction (12.1) that the oxygen atoms that were on the nitrate are just moved to water. The oxygen atoms either on the nitrate or the water molecules have 8 electrons for themselves (Figure 12.1). There has thus been no electron transfer to or from the oxygen atoms, regardless of the reactants or products of this reaction. It is important to emphasize again that oxygen atoms on nitrate DO NOT participate in the transfer of electrons in denitrification, or in any other anaerobic respiratory processes. Where did the electrons go, then? They went on the nitrogen atom. And one can see that on the dinitrogen molecule (Figure 12.1), each nitrogen atom now has 5 electrons for itself. This is why in reaction (12.1), there are two molecules of nitrate as reactants, yielding one molecule of \\(N_2\\) for a total of 2×5 = 10 electrons transferred. Because the nitrogen atom has accepted electrons, we say that it has be reduced. Because the byproduct of this reduction is a gas which escapes to the environment, and is not assimilated by the denitrifier microbes that do the reduction, we say that denitrification is a dissimilatory reduction . There is no such thing as ‘floating electrons’ in solution. So the reduction of the nitrogen atom of nitrate has to be associated with an oxidation, in the case of the organotrophic denitrification, to the oxidation of organic matter. This involves the redox couple \\(CO_2/CH_2O\\). The oxidation of organic matter (\\(CH_2O\\) for us in this example as detailed above) results in the loss of four electrons originally stored on the carbon of \\(CH_2O\\), resulting in \\(CO_2\\) where the carbon atom has lost all its electrons (Figure 12.1). Redox half-reactions are always written with the oxidant on the left and the reductant on the right. As a result, instead of expressing the oxidation of \\(CH_2O\\) into \\(CO_2\\), it is the opposite reaction that is written by convention in (12.2), i.e., the reduction of \\(CO_2\\) into \\(CH_2O\\) (which incidentally corresponds to what happens during photosynthesis): \\[\\begin{equation} CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightleftharpoons CH_2O + H_2O \\tag{12.2} \\end{equation}\\] The overall organotrophic denitrification is summarized in reaction (12.3) by multiplying the first half-reaction (12.1) by a factor of 2 and the second (12.2) by a factor of 5 to balance the number of electrons transferred. \\[\\begin{gather*} 4NO_3^- + 24 H^+ + 20 e^- \\rightleftharpoons 2N_2 + 12H_2O \\\\ 5CO_2 + 20 H^+ + 20 e^- \\rightleftharpoons 5CH_2O + 5H_2O \\\\ \\hline 5CH_2O + 4NO_3^- + 4 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons 5CO_2 + 2N_2 + 7H_2O \\tag{12.3} \\end{gather*}\\] Using reaction (12.3) and the electron allocation of the reactants and products as illustrated in Figure 12.1, one might see that oxygen is not involved in any step of the transfer of electrons in denitrification. This might be somewhat surprising to the reader, and it is not impossible that one might have read the contrary in some publications and books. It is tempting to treat oxygen atoms the same, whether they be in the form of \\(O_2\\) or \\(NO_3^-\\). But we have said times and again in this book that this is a big trap not to fall into! Oxygen is the most electronegative atom, and as a result, it tends to ‘steal’ electrons for itself from atoms to which it is bonded. Consequently, oxygen atoms bonded to CHNSP atoms always have 8 electrons for themselves. The only times when oxygen atoms do not have 8 electrons for themselves is when oxygen is bonded to itself, at least partly. This corresponds to dioxygen where each atom has 6 electrons for itself, and to hydrogen peroxide where each oxygen atom has 7 electrons for itself. The fact that the most electronegative atom, i.e., oxygen, existing in the form of \\(O_2\\) on our planet, drives most of the electron transfers! Indeed, oxygen ‘badly wants’ 8 electrons for itself. And in aerobic respirations, it manages just that. In Figure 12.2 the electron transfer scheme introduced in Chapter 5 is combined with the half-reactions (12.1) and (12.2), and with the electron allocation diagrams. The additional piece of information in Figure 12.2 is the fate of the N, S, and P atoms originally part of the organic matter during its oxidation. In organotrophic respirations, the byproducts of the oxidation of organic matter are \\(CO_2\\), \\(NH_4^+\\), \\(H_2S\\), and \\(PO_4^{3-}\\), because, again, only the carbon atoms participate in the transfer of electrons. Figure 12.2: Combined electron transfer scheme with the electron allocation, the transfer of electrons, and the corresponding half redox reactions for organotrophic denitrification 12.0.2 Some outside the box redox reactions 12.0.2.1 Guanidinium nitrate reaction to inflate air bags Guanidinium nitrate , commonly called guanidine nitrate, is a crystal that contains together potential electron donors in the form of fully reduced nitrogen on the guanidinium cation and fully oxidized nitrogen on the nitrate anion side. This crystal is used in air bags of vehicles as it is rather stable, only needs a spark to explode, and has a relatively low temperature of reaction. Let us explore this reaction. First, the hint that it is used to rapidly blow air bags tells us that gas(es) must be produced. Because the nitrogen atoms of the guanidinium side have 8 electrons to give, and nitrate ions have none and can gain some, the end gas product that contains nitrogen must have a number of electrons somewhat between the two. The first guess is \\(N_2\\) as each atom has 5 electrons for itself. So the two redox couples at play must be \\(NO_3^-/N_2\\) and \\(N_2/C(NH_2)_3^+\\). Figure 12.3: Ball and stick structure of guanidinium nitrate sometimes used as a fuel for airbag inflation However, on one guanidinium, there are three nitrogen atoms fully reduced for a combined 24 electrons to give (8 e- on each of the N atom), although when oxidized into \\(N_2\\) (5 e- on each of the N atom), each atom would lose 3 electrons for a combined 9 electrons lost. Nitrate reduction into \\(N_2\\) involves accepting 5 electrons. So there is an imbalance of 4 electrons in the electron transfer from nitrogen atoms of guanidinium to the one nitrogen of nitrate… The only solution is for the carbon of guanidinium, which has no electron for itself, to accept these 4 electrons. But then, how can carbon atoms be floating around on their own…? The octet rule must be fulfilled in all cases… Carbon atoms can actually form direct bonds with themselves as solid carbon, written as \\(C_{(s)}\\), and therefore accept 4 electrons. If dioxygen is present, then the formation of solid carbon usually does not happen as dioxygen steals these electrons first. But in the case of an airbag cartridge, there is very little space for dioxygen, the formation of \\(C_{(s)}\\) can occur. Now, one can balance the two half reactions involved. Nitrate being the most oxidizing agent, the first redox couple is considered. Its first reaction can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} 2NO_3^- + 12 H^+ + 10 e^- \\rightleftharpoons N_2 + 6H_2O \\tag{12.1} \\end{equation}\\] The dinitrogen/guanidinium redox couple is quite interesting as it involves another redox reactive atom: carbon. In these cases, the general approach is to leave the atoms as they are, provided that there is a possibility for the octet rule of the reactants/products to be fulfilled. Here, the solution is solid carbon \\(C_{(s)}\\). Hence the half redox equation for this couple: \\[\\begin{equation} 3N_2 + 2C_{(s)} + 12 H^+ + 10 e^- \\rightleftharpoons 2C(NH_2)_3^+ \\tag{12.4} \\end{equation}\\] On both half-reactions (12.1) and (12.4), the same number of electrons (10) are transferred and can be directly combined to obtain the final reaction (12.5). \\[\\begin{gather*} 2NO_3^- + 12 H^+ + 10 e^- \\rightleftharpoons N_2 + 6H_2O \\\\ 3N_2 + 2C_{(s)} + 12 H^+ + 10 e^- \\rightleftharpoons 2C(NH_2)_3^+ \\\\ \\hline C(NH_2)_3^+ \\space NO_3^- \\rightleftharpoons 2N_2 + 3H_2O + C_{(s)} \\tag{12.5} \\end{gather*}\\] The decomposition of one mole of solid guanidinium nitrate, upon an activation energy provided by a spark, produces into 5 moles of gas (2 moles of dinitrogen and 3 moles of water), and one mole of solid carbon. Because the electron donors and acceptors are closely packed together, the reaction is not limited by the transport of an electron acceptor near the donor (as is the case for burning wood for example), this reaction is fast. An instantaneous reaction that produce 5 moles of gas from a mole of solid compound has an explosive effect, hence its use in air bag deployment. Now, one might ask: why is it that the only hypothetical gas produced should be \\(N_2\\) and not \\(N_2O\\) for example? After all, in nitrous oxide , the middle oxygen has 3 electrons for itself and the other one 5, for an average of 4, which is closer to the midpoint between the amine groups (each N contains 8) and the nitrate (0 electrons on N). Let us thus explore the \\(NO_3^-/N_2O\\) and \\(N_2O/C(NH_2)_3^+\\) redox couples and the resulting reaction. The half-reaction of the most oxidizing redox couple \\(NO_3^-/N_2O\\) can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} 2NO_3^- + 10 H^+ + 8 e^- \\rightleftharpoons N_2O + 5H_2O \\tag{12.6} \\end{equation}\\] And the half-reaction of the more reducing \\(N_2O/C(NH_2)_3^+\\) can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} 3N_2O + 2C_{(s)} + 18 H^+ + 16 e^- \\rightleftharpoons 2C(NH_2)_3^+ + 3H_2O \\tag{12.7} \\end{equation}\\] Half-reaction (12.6) needs to be multiplied by a factor of 2 to have the same number of electrons transferred (16). The resulting oxidation of guanidinium nitrate leading to the formation of nitrous oxide can be written as in (12.8). \\[\\begin{gather*} 4NO_3^- + 20 H^+ + 16 e^- \\rightleftharpoons N_2O + 10H_2O \\\\ 3N_2O + 2C_{(s)} + 18 H^+ + 16 e^- \\rightleftharpoons 2C(NH_2)_3^+ + 3H_2O \\\\ \\hline 2C(NH_2)_3^+ + 4NO_3^- +2H^+ \\rightleftharpoons 5N_2O + 2C_{(s)} + 7H_2O \\tag{12.8} \\end{gather*}\\] Clearly this reaction is possible in theory. However, in practice it probably does not happen because 1) it requires the presence of protons, which would not be there in the guanidinium nitrate crystals, and 2) it would require twice as many nitrate as many guanidinium, and here too, this stochiometry is not that of the guanidinium nitrate salt. So this reaction is probably not happening when airbags are set on. 12.0.2.2 Chemolithotrophic denitrification on pyrite Pyrite (\\(FeS_2\\)) is an interesting mineral and illustrates quite well the difference between covalent bonds and an ionic bond. In the case of covalent bonds, electrons are shared between non-metal ions, in ionic bonds, one metal and a non-metal atom exchange electrons. In ionic bonds, we cannot use the electronegativity concept any longer to allocate electrons. So, although Sulfur atom is more electronegative (2.58) than iron (1.83), Sulfur does not steal electrons from iron. So the ions involved in pyrite are \\(Fe^{2+}(S^-)_2\\). Iron is thus in its most reduced form, for an oxidation state (OS) of (+II) corresponding to its charge referred to as ferrous iron or iron (II), and sulfur is also reduced in the form of \\(S^-\\), having 7 electrons for itself for an oxidation state of (-I). The summation of the OS is +II -I -I = 0, corresponding to the zero charge of the overall crystal. Because the sulfur has 7 electron for itself, it can be oxidized, obviously by dioxygen, but interestingly for biogeochemical purposes, by nitrate as well. The full oxidation of sulfur, i.e., the loss of all 7 electrons, leads to the formation of sulfate. The reduction of nitrate generally leads to the formation of dinitrogen although the reduction all the way to ammonium is possible in the reaction called Dissimilatory Reduction of Nitrate into Ammonium (DNRA). In nature, it seems that the reduction of nitrate stops at the \\(N_2\\) stage. From all this information, it is possible to draw the two redox couple involved. The more oxidative couple is \\(NO_3^-/N_2\\) and the one that involves pyrite oxidation into sulfate is \\(SO_4^{2-}/FeS_2\\). The nitrate reduction into dinitrogen is half-reaction (12.1), \\[\\begin{equation} 2NO_3^- + 12 H^+ + 10 e^- \\rightleftharpoons N_2 + 6H_2O \\tag{12.1} \\end{equation}\\] and the pyrite oxidation: \\[\\begin{equation} 2SO_4^{2-} + Fe^{2+} + 16 H^+ + 14 e^- \\rightleftharpoons FeS_2 + 8 H_2O \\tag{12.9} \\end{equation}\\] The overall reduction of nitrate by pyrite is summarized in reaction (12.10) by multiplying the first half-reaction (12.1) by a factor of 7 and the second (12.9) by a factor of 5 to balance the electrons transferred. \\[\\begin{gather*} 14NO_3^- + 84 H^+ + 70 e^- \\rightleftharpoons 7N_2 + 42H_2O \\\\ 10SO_4^{2-} + 5Fe^{2+} + 80 H^+ + 70 e^- \\rightleftharpoons 5FeS_2 + 40 H_2O \\\\ \\hline 5FeS_2 + 14NO_3^- + 4H^+ \\rightleftharpoons 10SO_4^{2-} + 5Fe^{2+} + 7N_2 + 2H_2O \\tag{12.10} \\end{gather*}\\] Now, there is another twist to chemolithotrophic denitrification using pyrite as the primary electron acceptor. Several studies surmised that nitrate could be further denitrified by the produced \\(Fe^{2+}\\) of pyrite oxidation (Kölle, Strebel, and Böttcher 1983, 1985, 1990; Pauwels 1994, 1994; Somlette 1999). But it was not until 1996, that actual evidence of Nitrate-Dependent Fe-Oxidation (NDFO) or Nitrate Reducing Fe Oxidation (NRFeOx, K. L. Straub et al. (1996)) microbial activity was brought forth. In other words, people have found that there were bacteria able to use ferrous Fe (II) as an electron donor, and nitrate as the electron acceptor. This has later been confirmed in many different environments including lake sediments, in pyrite containing schist, sandy and gravelly sediments, etc. (K. L. Straub et al. 1996; K. L. Straub and Buchholz-Cleven 1998; Lack et al. 2002; Kristina L. Straub et al. 2004; Kappler and Straub 2005; Kappler, Schink, and Newman 2005; Weber, Achenbach, and Coates 2006; Muehe et al. 2009; Blöthe and Roden 2009; Chakraborty et al. 2011; Chakraborty and Picardal 2013; Melton et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2019; reviewed by Bryce et al. 2018) (Figure 12.4). Figure 12.4: I. Chemolithotrophic bacteria Thiobacillus denitrificans used pyrite (FeS2) as electron donor, and nitrate as electron acceptor, reducing them to N2 and N2O. II. The ferrous iron Fe2+ produced is then used by other microorganisms that use Fe2+ as electron donors and nitrate, again as electron acceptor. These are called Nitrate Reducing Fe Oxidazing organisms. Some are autotrophs, mixotrophs (need both organic carbon and Fe2+ to live), or chemodenitrifiers (require organic carbon and have no enzymatic component of Fe(II) oxidation). After (Bryce et al. 2018) As a result, reaction (12.10) actually continues as the produced ferrous Fe (II) can be further oxidized by nitrate. The most oxidizing couple is still \\(NO_3^-/N_2\\), and the most reducing is now \\(Fe(OH)_3/Fe^{2+}\\). One could choose \\(Fe^{3+}\\) instead of \\(Fe(OH)_3\\), but at groundwater pH and reduced conditions when nitrate is still present, Fe (III) is more stable as iron hydroxides (Hem 1985; Stumm and Morgan 1996; Fetter 2008; Torrentó et al. 2010; reviewed by Bryce et al. 2018). Other authors proposed that the goethite mineral (\\(FeOOH\\)) would be formed instead of \\(Fe(OH)_3\\) iron hydroxides (Kölle, Strebel, and Böttcher 1985, 1990; Cheng et al. 2020). Ottley et al. (1997) actually listed 12 other possible \\(Fe^{2+}\\) oxidation reactions by nitrate. The one described below appears to be considered as prevalent (reviewed by Bryce et al. 2018). The half reaction for the \\(Fe(OH)_3/Fe^{2+}\\) can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} Fe(OH)_3 + 3 H^+ + 1 e^- \\rightleftharpoons Fe_2^+ + 3H_2O \\tag{12.11} \\end{equation}\\] Combining both half-reactions (12.1) and (12.11) and multiplying each by the proper factor to exchange the same number of electrons yields: \\[\\begin{gather*} 2NO_3^- + 12 H^+ + 10 e^- \\rightleftharpoons N_2 + 6H_2O \\\\ 10Fe(OH)_3 + 30 H^+ + 10 e^- \\rightleftharpoons 10Fe_2^+ + 30H_2O \\\\ \\hline 5Fe^{2+} + NO_3^- + 12H_2O \\rightleftharpoons 5Fe(OH)_3 + 9H^ + \\frac{1}{2}N_2 \\tag{12.12} \\end{gather*}\\] Now, literally adding reactions (12.10) and (12.12) yields: \\[\\begin{gather*} 5FeS_2 + 14NO_3^- + 4H^+ \\rightleftharpoons 10SO_4^{2-} + 5Fe^{2+} + 7N_2 + 2H_2O \\\\ 5Fe^{2+} + NO_3^- + 12H_2O \\rightleftharpoons 5Fe(OH)_3 + 9H^+ + \\frac{1}{2}N_2 \\\\ \\hline 5FeS_2 + 15NO_3^- + 10H_2O \\rightleftharpoons 5Fe(OH)_3 + \\frac{15}{2}N_2 + 10SO_4^{2-} + 5H^+ \\tag{12.13} \\end{gather*}\\] Figure 12.5: Concentrations of Sulfate and hydrogen sulfide as a function of pε (#fig:CO2-CH_2O-pe)Concentrations of a generic carbohydrate CH_2O and CO2 that would be in equilibrium with the atmosphere as a function of pε and for a given pH Figure 12.6: Concentrations ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate as a function of pε and for a given pH This chapter is still under construction References "],["gassolubilitychapter.html", "Chapter 13 Dissolved gases in water 13.1 Henry’s law and the dissolution of gases in water 13.2 Solubility of gases as a function of temperature {#sol-f-temp)} 13.3 Actual solubility values of water in equilibrium with the atmosphere 13.4 Solubility of gases as a function of pressure", " Chapter 13 Dissolved gases in water Chapter summary: Let us admit it: dissolved gases have been a bit of a mystery for all of us at one point. There have been many articles written and a book has recently been published (Colt 2012) on the subject giving all the numbers and constants one could dream of…! So the subject is both relatively simple in principle but far from simple in the details. This chapter presents the principles and enough, and hopefully not too much, of the details. When one sees sparkling water, it is obvious that there is gas dissolved in it as bubbles form on their own and one can see them form and escape. They also apparently seem to form more when the water temperature is warm than when a sparkling water bottle just comes out of the fridge (Figure 13.1). Figure 13.1: Dissolved gas bubble formation from a sparkling water bottle at 4°C and 25°C Figure 13.1 shows that temperature has to do something with how gases may dissolve in water. At warm temperature, the opening of the sparkling water bottle is accompanied by the release of gas under pressure in the bottle headspace and the sudden formation of many bubbles. At low temperature, the gas release upon opening is not nearly as high, and the number of bubbles forming and bubbling up is much lower. Another observation is that before the opening of the bottle, there are few bubbles apparent on the bottle sides, so under some pressure in the headspace, the gases appear to stay dissolved, and it is only after the bottle has been opened and that the bottle headspace is at atmospheric pressure that gas bubbles appear ‘from no where’ in a process called ebullition. This simple experience thus shows several things: at low and high temperatures, the pressure in the bottle headspace is respectively lower and higher, suggesting that there is more gas in the head space at higher temperature, and thus more dissolved gases at lower temperatures as the headspace pressure is released, gases are released suggesting that more gas can be dissolved in water when water is under pressure. We shall see what this really means later in this chapter Figure 13.2: Formation of gas bubbles attached to a biofilm (periphyton) scraped from an organic sediment in a tidal marsh There are other interesting observations to consider. You might have already observed bubble formation in a stream during Spring or Summer a bit like in the picture in Figure 13.2. These bubbles are attached to a biofilm scraped from a stream bottom in North Carolina. Obviously, the presence of bubbles is not necessarily very informative about dissolved gases, but the sparkling water experience above suggests that in reality, if there are bubbles, there must necessarily be dissolved gases associated. Figure 13.3: Gas bubbling from the sediment of a low gradient stream when disturbed One last introductory experience you might have had, is the release of gas bubbles when you might have disturbed the sediment of a wetland or a stream sediment when you stepped on it a bit like in the above video (Figure 13.3). Obviously, gases must have accumulated in the sediment and it took some disturbance to release them. This suggests that there are gas formation processes in treatment systems, but that we already knew (see Chapter on sediment redox processes). The additional information is how gases dissolve or form bubbles. So this chapter explores the conditions for which gases dissolve or form bubbles, the driving factors behind, and the consequences for biogeochemical processes. 13.1 Henry’s law and the dissolution of gases in water English chemist William Henry published his results from his experiments on the dissolution of gases in 1803 (Henry and Banks 1803), and reported in page 42 of the January 1803 issue of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London that […] it follows, that water takes up, of gas condensed by one, two, or more additional atmospheres, a quantity which, ordinarily compressed, would be equal to twice, thrice, &amp;c. the volume absorbed under the common pressure of the atmosphere (Henry and Banks 1803). In other words, Henry’s law states that the amount of dissolved gas in a liquid is proportional to its partial pressure above the liquid. The winner of first Nobel price in Chemistry (1901), Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van’t Hoff later formulated in 1884 how the dissolution of the gases depends on the temperature, in what is now referred to as the van’t Hoff equation (equation (13.2); van’t Hoff (1884)). Henry’s law has several important consequences for ecological engineering: knowing the partial pressure of a gas in the atmosphere, it is possible to calculate the concentration of that gas in water, at least at equilibrium. it is possible to then compare the concentrations of gases in one liter of atmosphere versus those of one liter of water it is possible to calculate, for any given dissolved gas, what the equivalent partial pressure would be if it were at equilibrium with the atmosphere, and realize the reasons for the formation of bubbles in treatment systems (referred to as ebullution) realize that gases can be in ‘supersaturation’ in water, i.e., have more dissolved gases than when in equilibrium with the atmosphere, because of hydrostatic pressure, and/or because of the kinetics of gas production in treatment systems vs. the kinetics of equilibrium of gases with the atmosphere 13.1.1 Equivalence between gas partial pressures and dissolved concentration Henry’s law stipulates that the concentration in the aqueous phase \\(c_a\\) (subscript \\(a\\) for aqueous) of a dissolved gas A, i.e., the number of gas moles per liter of water, can be calculated as: \\[\\begin{equation} c_a(A) = K^{cp}_H(A).p_A \\tag{13.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(c_a(A)\\) is the concentration of dissolved gas A in water (\\(c\\) stands for concentration and the subscript \\(a\\) stands for aqueous), \\(K^{cp}_H(A)\\) is the Henry’s constant for gas A and at a given temperature, and \\(p_A\\) is the partial pressure of gas A in the head space above water. The use of \\(K^{cp}_H\\) here does not follow notation that might be found elsewhere (e.g., in Sander (2015) or on Wikipedia, where \\(K^{cp}_H\\) would be written as \\(H^{cp}\\)). This notation has been chosen here to correspond to the notation traditionally used in thermochemistry where equilibrium constants are noted “K”, and the subscript “H” refers to Henry (e.g., Stumm and Morgan (1996)), and also because the letter \\(H\\) also refers to as enthalpy in thermodynamics… The superscript \\(cp\\) in \\(K^{cp}_H\\) means that this Henry’s law constant yields an aqueous concentration (\\(c\\)) when multiplied by a gaseous pressure (\\(p\\)). Equation (13.1) thus characterize how soluble a gas is as a function of its pressure above in the gaseous phase. As a result, \\(K^{cp}_H\\) is referred to as a Henry’s law solubility constant. 13.1.2 Many different units to express gas solubility This is where things can start to be a bit confusing, as there are many ways of expressing the way gases behave with aqueous systems. One may be interested on how gases may dissolve in the aqueous phases (the term solubility is then used), or instead how gases may escape the aqueous system (the term volatility is then used) (e.g., Markham and Kobe 1941; Colt 2012; Sander 2015). In both cases, Henry’s law apply but the solubility and volatility constants are inverse of each other. As far as we are concerned, we will use Henry’s law solubility constants and ignore the volatility constants. In Equation (13.1) dissolved concentrations would be expressed in mol.L-1 (liter of water), pressures expressed in atm, which leaves the Henry’s solubility constant units to be mol.L-1.atm-1. That is the simple approach and this is in many cases enough. To be a bit more rigorous, however, one should speak about dimensions and then give potential units. So, Equation (13.1) expresses the dissolved gas concentration, which dimensions are [Mass.Volume-1] or more properly [M.L-3], where M is the letter for Mass, and L for length. In our domain of science, common units for concentrations are mol.L-1 or mg.L-1. The dimension of the partial pressure is [M.L-1.T-2], which is the equivalent of a force [M.L.T-2] spread over a surface [L-2], and where “T” refers to ‘Time’. Common units for pressures are atmosphere (atm), bars (bar), although the SI unit is called the Pascal (Pa), and the correspondence being 1 atm = 1.01325 bar = 101,325 Pa. As a result the dimensions for the Henry’s law solubility constant in Equation (13.1) are [M2.L-1.T-2], or more simply in common units mol.L-1.atm-1 as already mentioned. This or similar unit is the one that is more relevant to the domain of ecological engineering and the values for relevant gases are consigned in the first two columns of Table 13.1 below. Table 13.1: Henry’s law Constants of Importance in Gas-Water Equilibria at 25°C (values from Sander (2015) and www.henrys-law.org). \\(k^{cp}_H\\) and \\(K^{cp}_H\\) correspond to Henry’s solubility constants expressed in slighlty different units, \\(K^{cc}_H\\) is the unitless Henry’s solubility constant, calculated as the ratio \\(c_a/c_g\\), and \\(TempConst\\) corresponds to the van’t Hoff equation temperature factor described in the text Reactions \\(\\frac{k^{cp}_H(25°C)}{(mol.m^{-3}.Pa^{-1})}\\) \\(\\frac{K^{cp}_H(25°C)}{(M.atm^{-1})}\\) \\(\\frac{Temp Const}{(°K)}\\) \\(\\frac{K^{cc}_H}{(unitless)}\\) \\(He_{(g)} \\rightleftharpoons He_{(aq)}\\) 3.80e-06 3.85e-04 230 0.9% \\(Ne_{(g)} \\rightleftharpoons Ne_{(aq)}\\) 4.40e-06 4.51e-04 490 1.1% \\(Ar_{(g)} \\rightleftharpoons Ar_{(aq)}\\) 1.40e-05 1.42e-03 1300 3.5% \\(H_{2(g)} \\rightleftharpoons H_{2(aq)}\\) 7.80e-06 7.85e-04 500 1.9% \\(O_{2(g)} \\rightleftharpoons O_{2(aq)}\\) 1.25e-05 1.27e-03 1700 3.1% \\(CO_{(g)} \\rightleftharpoons CO_{(aq)}\\) 9.70e-06 9.83e-04 1300 2.4% \\(CO_{2(g)} \\rightleftharpoons CO_{2(aq)}\\) 3.35e-04 3.39e-02 2400 83% \\(CH_{4(g)} \\rightleftharpoons CH_{4(aq)}\\) 1.40e-05 1.42e-03 1600 3.5% \\(H_{2}S_{(g)} \\rightleftharpoons H_{2}S_{(aq)}\\) 1.00e-03 1.01e-01 2100 247.9% \\(N_{2(g)} \\rightleftharpoons N_{2(aq)}\\) 6.40e-06 6.48e-04 1300 1.6% \\(N_2O{(g)} \\rightleftharpoons N_2O{(aq)}\\) 2.40e-04 2.43e-02 2600 59.5% \\(NH_{3(g)} \\rightleftharpoons NH_{3(aq)}\\) 5.90e-01 5.98e+01 4200 146250.3% Yet, glancing through the values of the first and second columns of Table 13.1 might not necessarily trigger a big eureka, I understand how gas dissolve in water now…! Possibly a more telling approach is the comparison between the concentrations in the gaseous versus those in the aqueous phases. This is what the dimensionless Henry’s solubility constant \\(K^{cc}_H\\) does. This constant expresses the ratio between the concentrations (number of moles per liter) in the aqueous phase (\\(c_a\\)) over those in the gaseous phase (\\(c_g\\)), such that in the end \\(K^{cc}_H = \\frac{c_a}{c_g}\\) (the superscript \\(cc\\) in \\(K^{cc}_H\\) stands for concentration to concentration). This constant is dimensionless and can be expressed as a percentage value as reported in Table 13.1. Before discussing the values, visualizing the \\(c_a\\) and \\(c_g\\) concentrations aqueous and gaseous phases might help. Let us imagine containers that would be 2 liters in volume each, and containing 1 liter of water and 1 liter of gas head space above (Figure 13.4). The gaseous phase of the containers would be at 1 atm and filled with one pure gas only. Now to visualize the ratio of the number of moles in both phases, Henry’s law solubility constants in the first and second columns of Table 13.1 give the number of moles of gas dissolved per liter of water, assuming that the overlying gas is pure and at one atmosphere. The concentration in the gaseous phase can be calculated using the perfect gas law, which yields that at 25°C, one mole of gas takes about 24.47 liters, so the concentration in one liter of gas is \\(1/24.47 = 40.87 mmol.L^{-1}\\). More calculation details are provided in Exercise 13.1 below. The \\(\\frac{c_a}{c_g}\\) or \\(\\frac{liquid}{gas}\\) ratio for \\(O_2\\), \\(N_2O\\), and \\(CO_2\\) gases is illustrated in Figure 13.4A, B, and C, respectively, with 100 random points in the gaseous phase representing the 40.9 mmol.L-1 of gases present in 1L at 1atm, and, the corresponding 3, 59, and 83 points representing the respective gaseous concentrations \\(c_g\\). The ratios displayed at the bottom of the figure apply for water temperature at 25°C. Figure 13.4: Visual and liquid:gas proportions of the number of moles in the gaseous phase of one liter of gas at 1 atm overlying one liter of water, for O2, N2O, and CO2 gases, using the respective Henry’s solubility constants at 25°C. Blue rectangles represent one liter of water in equilibrium with one liter of pure gas (overlying white rectangle). There are 100 circles in the white rectangle representing the 40.9 mmol.L-1 of gases present in 1L at 1 atm at 25°C. The number of circles in the blue rectangles represent the respective and corresponding number of moles per liter of water Actually, the dimensionless Henry’s solubility constants reported at 25°C in the fourth column of Table 13.1 are valid regardless of the pressure in the gaseous phase. The numbers reveal two strikingly different types of gases: insoluble and soluble gases. All perfect gases reported as well as linear or non-polar molecules such as \\(O_2\\), \\(N_2\\), or \\(CH_4\\) are generally referred to as insoluble as at 25°C, and which concentrations in water are less than 3.5% those in the atmosphere above. Reversely, polar molecules such as \\(H_2S\\), \\(N_2O\\) and \\(NH_3\\) are very to extremely soluble. Ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are very polar molecules, with the S and N strongly electronegative and the hydrogen atoms electropositive, hence the ability to make very strong hydrogen bonds and the very high solubility of these two gases. \\(N_2O\\) also is polar as two Lewis dot structures coexist (\\(N\\equiv \\overset{+}{N}-O^- \\longleftrightarrow {}^-N=\\overset{+}{N}=O\\)), and in both cases, the center nitrogen atom is positevely charged and either the other nitrogen or the oxygen atoms are negatively charged. Carbon monoxide and dioxide are oddities. The carbon monoxide molecule is asymmetrical with a triple bond between the two atoms and one lone pair of electrons on each atom (:C≡O:). It turns out that despite the more electronegative oxygen atom, it is the carbon atom that is slightly more negative than the oxygen (Sato et al. 2000). As a result, hydrogen bonds do not form readily, but a little more than for \\(N_2\\), and less than for \\(O_2\\). The linear O=C=O carbon dioxide molecule does not have a net dipole but the carbon has an effective positive charge. It appears that experiments have shown that there are specific hydrogen bonding between the water molecule and the \\(CO_2\\) molecules (Sato et al. 2000), which renders carbon dioxide to be very soluble. The nature of these specific hydrogen bonding is not clear. The hydration of \\(CO_2\\) to carbonic acid (see details in Chapter 11) does not occur very much and cannot be a major factor to explain \\(CO_2\\) high solubility. There are additional units to express Henry’s solubility constants, which appear to depend on the scientific domains and applications. For example, a more universal dimension, which oceanographers preferably use is the solubility constant [Mass_of_dissolved_gas.Mass_of_water-1] often expressed as mol.kg-1 (kg of water). In freshwater systems one liter of water weighs very close to 1 kg, but for sea or brackish waters, the weight of water varies with salinity and it is more robust to express solubility in [Mass_of_dissolved_gas.Mass_of_water-1]. Another dimension/unit used for gases under pressure in water is [Volume_of_dissolved_gas.Volume_of_water-1] often expressed in mL.L-1 or L.L-1 (essentially dimensionless as well). This unit can be quite confusing. So this corresponds to the volume of gas (at one atm) that would be extracted (if one could) per unit volume of water. The Bunsen coefficient \\(\\alpha\\) is an application of this unit when temperature is at 0°C or 273.15°K and pressure at 1 atm. Examples presented in Exercise 13.1 clarify the correspondence between all the units presented here. A full list of all units used for Henry’s constants and the correspondence between them all is available in Colt (2012) and Sander (2015). Exercise 13.1 Calculate solubility in freshwater of pure O2, N2, and CO2 at 1 atm and 25°C in different units Let us take one liter of pure freshwater overlaid by one liter of pure gas at 1 atm. To calculate the solubility of these gases, one needs to just use the Henry’s law in the equation \\[\\begin{equation} c_a = K^{cp}_H.p \\end{equation}\\] In this exercise the gas partial pressure is equal to 1 atm. The unit available and given in Table 13.1 for \\(K^{cp}_H\\) is M.atm-1, i.e., mol.L-1.atm-1. Using Henry’s law and solubility constants, one can calculate the solubility values expressed in different units at 25°C: \\(K^{cp}_H(O_2)=1.27 \\space 10^{-3} mol.L^{-1}.atm^{-1}\\) \\(K^{cp}_H(N_2)=6.48 \\space 10^{-4} mol.L^{-1}.atm^{-1}\\) \\(K^{cp}_H(CO_2)=3.39 \\space 10^{-2} mol.L^{-1}.atm^{-1}\\) Solubility in \\(mol.L^{-1}\\) \\([O_{2(aq)}] = 1.27 \\space 10^{-3} \\times 1 = 1.27 \\space 10^{-3} \\space mol.L^{-1}\\) \\([N_{2(aq)}] = 6.48 \\space 10^{-4} \\times 1 = 6.48 \\space 10^{-4} \\space mol.L^{-1}\\) \\([CO_{2(aq)}] = 3.39 \\space 10^{-2} \\times 1 = 3.39 \\space 10^{-2} \\space mol.L^{-1}\\) the \\(\\times 1\\) in the above equations correspond to pressure at 1 atm. Solubility in \\(mol.kg^{-1}\\) To express solubilities in mol.kg^{-1}, one must multiply the above results by the density of water at 25°C. The density, in \\(kg.m^{-3}\\), of water as a function of temperature for the range 5°C to 40°C can be expressed as (Jones and Harris 1992): for air-free water: \\(\\rho = 999.85308 + 6.32693 \\times 10^{-2}.t - 8.523829 \\times 10^{-3}.t^2 + 6.943248 \\times 10^{-5}.t^3 \\\\ -3.821216\\times 10^{-7}.t^4\\) for air-saturated water: \\(\\rho = 999.84847 + 6.337563 \\times 10^{-2}.t - 8.523829 \\times 10^{-3}.t^2 + 6.943248 \\times 10^{-5}.t^3 \\\\ -3.821216\\times 10^{-7}.t^4\\) Using the air-saturated equation, the density of freshwater at 25°C would be \\(\\rho = 0.997041 \\space kg.L^{-1}\\) \\([O_{2(aq)}] = 1.27 \\space 10^{-3} \\div 0.997041 = 1.27 \\space 10^{-3} \\space mol.kg^{-1}\\) \\([N_{2(aq)}] = 6.48 \\space 10^{-4} \\div 0.997041 = 6.50 \\space 10^{-4} \\space mol.kg^{-1}\\) \\([CO_{2(aq)}] = 3.39 \\space 10^{-2} \\div 0.997041 = 3.40 \\space 10^{-2} \\space mol.kg^{-1}\\) Unitless Henry’s solubility constant To calculate the ratio of aqueous vs. gaseous concentrations, one needs to first calculate the concentration of each gas in the head space at 1 atm. For that, we use the ideal gas equation: \\[\\begin{equation} PV = nRT \\\\ V = \\frac{nRT}{P} \\end {equation}\\] Using the conditions where \\(P = 1 \\: atm = 101,325 Pa\\), \\(n = 1 \\: mol\\), \\(R = 8.314 \\space m^3⋅Pa⋅K^{−1}⋅mol^{−1}\\), and \\(T = 25°C = 298.15°K\\) \\[\\begin{equation} V = \\frac{1 \\times 8.314 \\times 298.15}{101,325} \\end {equation}\\] Assuming perfect gases, one mole of gas would occupy 24.46 L. In other words, in one liter of gas at 1 atm, there are \\(1/24.46 = 4.09.10^{-2}\\) moles of gas. From this, it is possible to calculate the unitless Henry’s solubility constant \\(K^{cc}_H\\) by dividing the aqueous concentrations by the gaseous concentration ( \\(\\frac{c_a}{c_g}\\)). This yields: \\(K^{cc}_H(O_2) = \\frac{1.27.10^{-3}}{4.09.10^{-2}} = 3.1\\%\\) \\(K^{cc}_H(N_2) = \\frac{6.48.10^{-4}}{4.09.10^{-2}} = 1.6\\%\\) \\(K^{cc}_H(CO_2) = \\frac{3.39.10^{-2}}{4.09.10^{-2}} = 82.9\\%\\) Solubility in \\(ml.L^{-1}\\) This unit expresses the volume of gas that could be extracted from a solution, and that volume at 1 atm. To calculate solubility in this unit, one just needs to multiply the \\(K^{cp}_H\\) solubility constant by the molar volume of a real or perfect gas. Assuming to deal with a perfect gas, \\(Vol_{O_{2(aq)}} = 1.27.10^{-3} \\times 24.46 = 31.1 mL.L^{-1}\\) \\(Vol_{N_{2(aq)}} = 6.48.10^{-4} \\times 24.46 = 15.9 mL.L^{-1}\\) \\(Vol_{CO_{2(aq)}} = 3.39.10^{-2} \\times 24.46 = 829 mL.L^{-1}\\) These values also correspond to \\(10 \\times K^{cc}_H\\). in reality, actual gases do not behave like perfect gases and actual molar volumes differ a little bit. Approximating actual gases to perfect gases is good enough for our purpose. In reality the concept of solubility extends beyond gases in liquid, and “is the property of a solid, liquid or gaseous chemical substance called solute to dissolve in a solid, liquid or gaseous solvent” (Wikipedia contributors 2020c). In most cases the solvent is a liquid. As the activity of solute and solvents vary with temperature, the solubility of gases in water varies with temperature, and the van’t Hoff equation is the formulation of this relationship. 13.2 Solubility of gases as a function of temperature {#sol-f-temp)} Everyone has experienced the consequences of opening a can of soda coming from the fridge or coming from a car having spent some time under a hot sun in summer, and a less dramatic effect is illustrated in Figure 13.1… As a recall, in the first case, opening the can makes a small noise as this releases a little bit of gas (largely corresponding to the extra \\(CO_2\\) forcefully dissolved under 4 bars at 4°C during bottling). In the second case, it will be a very noisy mess as bubbles of soda will try to violently escape! This experience shows that the pressure of gas in the headspace in the cans is much higher under warm than under cold temperatures. Because all the cans are bottled under the same cold conditions hence containing about the same number of moles of gases, the number of moles of dissolved gas under cold conditions is greater than under warm ones. Henry’s law as formulated in equation (13.1) applies for any given temperature. Henry’s constant is the parameter that changes with temperature. The van’t Hoff equation gives the values of Henry’s constant for any given temperature (equation (13.2)): \\[\\begin{equation} K^{cp}_H(T) = K^{cp}_H(T_0).exp \\left[ \\left( \\frac {-\\Delta_{sol}H}{R} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{T} - \\frac{1}{T_0} \\right) \\right] \\tag{13.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(K^{cp}_H(T)\\) and \\(K^{cp}_H(T_0)\\) represent the Henry’s solubility constants, respectively for \\(T\\) and the \\(T_0\\) (in °K), the latter being the reference temperature (usually at 25°C or 298.15°K), \\(\\Delta_{sol}H\\) represents the enthalpy of dissolution, \\(R\\) is the perfect gas constant (8.314 J.mol−1.K−1)2. The values for the term \\(\\frac {-\\Delta_{sol}H}{R}\\) in equation (13.2) represent a temperature constant in Kelvin and depend on the gases. In the form above, the van’t Hoff equation is only valid for a limited temperature range in which \\(\\Delta_{sol}H\\) does not change much with temperature, which is the case for natural waters (Sander 2015). Again, the term \\(\\frac {-\\Delta_{sol}H}{R}\\) represents a temperature constant, which values are summarized in Table 13.1 under the column heading TempConst. The values of the Henry’s law constant at reference temperature \\(K^{cp}_H(T_0)\\) are summarized using the SI (SI, abbreviated from the French Système international (d’unités)) units (\\(mol.m^{-3}.Pa^{-1}\\)) and practical units (\\(M.atm^{-1}\\), i.e., \\(mol.L^{-1}.atm^{-1}\\)) in Table 13.1. All values have been obtained from Sander (2015), which are regularly updated on www.henrys-law.org. Using the van’t Hoff equation to predict Henry’s constants for any given temperature, it is possible to plot the solubility (in mol.L-1 in water) of common gases relevant to ecological engineering between 0 and 40°C (Figure 13.5A). These solubility values are calculated for pure gases at 1 atm of pressure and are thus comparable from one to another (the actual solubilities for normal air at 1 atm are illustrated in Figure 13.6). Notice that the solubility values for \\(CO_2\\), \\(H_2S\\) and \\(N_2O\\) are plotted in dotted lines and are read on the secondary Y-axis. Solubility values for these gases are 10 to 50 times larger than the ones for \\(O_2\\), \\(H_2\\), \\(N_2\\), \\(CO\\), and \\(CH_4\\), which are plotted as solid lines. Exercise 13.2 Formula of the solubility of pure O2 at 1 atm as a function of temperature T in °C To express this formula, one needs to combine Henry’s law and van’t Hoff equations: \\[\\begin{equation} [O_{2(aq)}] = K_H(T_0).exp \\left[ \\left( \\frac {-\\Delta_{sol}H}{R} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{T} - \\frac{1}{T_0} \\right) \\right].P_{O_2} \\end{equation}\\] The values for the terms \\(K_H(T_0)\\) (in mol.L-1.atm-1) and \\(\\frac {-\\Delta_{sol}H}{R}\\) (in °K) are provided in Table 13.1. The van’t Hoff equation uses temperature in °K. The conversion equation is \\(T(°K) = T(°C) + 273.15\\). A partial numerical application of this equation for dissolved oxygen expressed in mol.L-1 in one liter of water overlaid by one liter of pure oxygen at 1 atm using T in °C would yield: \\[\\begin{equation} [O_{2(aq)}] = 1.27 \\space 10^{-3}exp \\left[ 1700\\left( \\frac{1}{T+273.15} - \\frac{1}{25+273.15} \\right) \\right] \\times 1 \\end{equation}\\] In Figure 13.5B, the ratio of the number of moles in water and those in the overlying gas are calculated by dividing the solubility in mol.L-1 displayed in Figure 13.5B, by the number of moles in the overlying gaseous phase. This number varies with temperature, and is calculated using the ideal gas equation as \\(n = \\frac{PV}{RT}\\) where all letters and values are defined in Exercise 13.1. Figure 13.5: Solubility plots for common gases relevant to ecological engineering expressed in mol.L-1 (A) and unitless % as the ratio of \\(c_a/c_g\\) (B). Each gas is assumed to be at 1 atm of pressure in the gaseous phase. Notice that the value for \\(CO_2\\), \\(H_2S\\) and \\(N_2O\\) are read on the secondary Y-axis These plots show several striking results. First, they confirm that \\(O_2\\), \\(H_2\\), \\(N_2\\), \\(CO\\), and \\(CH_4\\) do not dissolve well into water, regardless of temperature, as no more than 2% to 5% of the molecules in the gaseous phase are dissolved at equilibrium. For dioxygen gas, at 10°C and 25°C, respectively 4% and 3% of \\(O_2\\) present in the atmosphere above are dissolved in water. This suggests that the mere amount of dioxygen in an aquatic milieu is rather limited and about 30 times less than what is available in a gaseous milieu. Although life seems to have sprung in water, it is clear that it was a lot more advantageous for organisms to live in a gaseous milieu for this reason. But then organisms had to find ways to obtain water, and not lose it, hence the plethora of adaptations from organisms to adapt to these relatively dry conditions. For ecological engineering purposes, this observation is one of the main reasons why \\(O_{2(aq)}\\) is limited in water and why the respiratory demand for oxygen in treatment systems tends not to be matched by supply, hence the very common presence of anaerobic zones (more details in section 8.2). Second, contrary to the previous gases, \\(CO_2\\), \\(H_2S\\), and \\(N_2O\\) readily dissolve in water to the point that at 10°C, there are more moles of \\(CO_2\\) and \\(H_2S\\) dissolved in water than there are in the overlying atmosphere, respectively about 1.2 and 3.5 times more! At the same temperature, there is almost the same number of moles of \\(N_2O\\) dissolved in water (90%) as there are in the gaseous phase. This also means that at 10°C one could extract 1.2 L of CO2 out of 1 L of water! Exercise 13.3 Calculate the volume of CO2 stored in a bottle of Champagne at 10°C First, one needs to know that the volume (\\(V_{ch}\\)) of liquid in a bottle of Champagne is 75 cL or 0.75 L. Second, people have actually measured the pressure in the headspace pressure (\\(p_{CO_2}\\)) and it easily reaches 5 bars (≈72 psi). Pressure in a car tire is about 2.2 (≈32 psi) bars, for comparison. This is why the corks on a bottle of Champagne are maintained with a wire to prevent corks to pop out on their own! But why is there pressure in there? Most of the gas under pressure is actually CO2 resulting from the fermentation processes. To calculate the actual solubility is far from easy because the wine composition itself has an impact on solubility… One of the sought after quality of a Champagne wine is the size of the gas bubbles that form: the smaller the better, and that is a fine art. This is not the goal of this exercise. We shall approximate the Champagne wine to be pure water and that all the dissolved gas is CO2. In reality, we know that there is no oxygen because of the fermentation. There is dinitrogen most likely at equilibrium with the atmosphere when the grapes were pressed. But we will take this to be negligible. From the information given above, the dissolved CO2 concentration can be calculated as: \\[\\begin{equation} [CO_{2(aq)}] = K^{cp}_H(T_0).exp \\left[ \\left( \\frac {-\\Delta_{sol}H}{R} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{T} - \\frac{1}{T_0} \\right) \\right] \\times p_{CO_2} \\end{equation}\\] using the terms defined previously. The number of dissolved moles in the bottle is thus \\(n_{CO_{2(aq)}} = [CO_{2(aq)}] \\times V_{ch}\\). The volume taken by this number of moles is thus \\(V_{CO_2} = n_{CO_{2(aq)}} \\times Vol_{PerfectGas}(T)\\) Overall, the volume of CO2 stored in a bottle of Champagne at 10°C could be calculated as: \\[\\begin{equation} V_{CO_2} = K^{cp}_H(T_0).exp \\left[ \\left( \\frac {-\\Delta_{sol}H}{R} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{T} - \\frac{1}{T_0} \\right) \\right] \\times p_{CO_2} \\times V_{ch} \\times \\frac{RT}{P} \\end{equation}\\] Using: \\(T_0\\) = 25°C = 298.15°K, \\(K^{cp}_H(T_0) = 3.39 \\space 10^{-2} mol.L^{-1}.atm^{-1}\\) \\(T\\) = 10°C = 283.15°K \\(\\frac {-\\Delta_{sol}H}{R} = 2400°K\\) \\(p_{CO_2}\\) = 5 bars = 5/1.01325 atm \\(V_{ch}\\) = 0.75 L \\(P = 1 \\: atm = 101325 Pa\\), \\(R = 8314 \\space L⋅Pa⋅K^{−1}⋅mol^{−1}\\) \\[\\begin{equation} V_{CO_2} = 3.39 \\space 10^{-2}.exp \\left[ 2400 \\left( \\frac{1}{283.15} - \\frac{1}{298.15} \\right) \\right] \\times \\frac{5}{1.0325} \\times 0.75 \\times \\frac{8314 \\times 283.15}{101325} \\end{equation}\\] \\(V_{CO_2} = 4.47 L\\) The temperature chosen to calculate the molar volume of a perfect gas was chosen to be 10°C like the water temperature. Another value could have been chosen to possibly represent room temperature. Yet, it is remarkable to realize how much CO2 can be dissolved in sparkling water, and in the case of spakling wine or beer, that most of the CO2 was produced by microbes through fermentation 13.3 Actual solubility values of water in equilibrium with the atmosphere Now, it is time to look at the actual solubilities and concentrations of four of the most abundant gases in the atmosphere (excluding water vapor, considered to be at 1% at sea level and 0.4% overall in the atmospher): dinitrogen (78%), dioxygen (21%), argon (9,340 ppm or 0.934%), and carbon dioxide (415 ppm in 2020). Dinitrogen is among the least soluble gases (Figure 13.5), but because it comprises the vast majority of the atmosphere (78%), its overall actual solubility expressed in mmol.L-1 is the highest and about 1.5 times that of dioxygen (Figure 13.6). The second most dissolved gas is O2, the third is CO2, and the fourth is argon (Figure 13.6). Solubility of argon at 1 atm is about 1.14 times that of oxygen, but its actual solubility is lower than CO2, despite the fact that its partial pressure in the atmosphere is about 23 times that of CO2 in 2020. Solubility of CO2 at 1 atm is about 30 times higher than that of O2, but in year 2020 the atmospheric concentration was about 415 ppm or 0.0415% or about 500 times less than the 21% of O2. In the end, the theoretical solubility of CO2 in water is about 17 times lower than that of O2, which is remarkable for a gas that is 500 times less present in the atmosphere! Do not forget, however, that some of the CO2 becomes hydrated into carbonic acid and dissociates into carbonates. But as we saw in the chapter dedicated to dissolved carbon dioxide, the dissociation into carbonates does not influence, in an open system, the concentration of dissolved CO2. Figure 13.6: Solubility graph for \\(N_2\\), \\(O_2\\), and \\(CO_2\\) at equilibrium with the atmosphere, assuming \\(P_{N_2} = 0.78 atm\\), \\(P_{O_2} = 0.21 atm\\), and \\(P_{CO_2} = 410 ppm\\). Dissolved \\(O_2\\) concentration, i.e., where the partial pressure of \\(O_2\\) is equal to 0.21 atm. The corresponding concentrations in mg O2.L-1 are read on the secondary axis Obviously, the solubility of dioxygen is very relevant to aquatic life in general and to biogeochemical processes in the aqueous environment! Again, the van’t Hoff equation tells us that the concentrations of dissolved gases under atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing temperature. Life for pluricellular organisms, which exclusively use dioxygen as their electron acceptor, becomes difficult to impossible: when \\([O_{2(aq)}]&lt;2 \\space mg \\space O_2.L^{-1}\\), the general condition is referred to as hypoxia or hypoxic waters (Greek hypo- = under, oxy-,oxi- = concerns oxygen), and most pluricellular organisms are under severe respiratory stress. when \\([O_{2(aq)}]&lt;0.5 \\space mg \\space O_2.L^{-1}\\), the general condition is referred to as anoxia, or the absence or near absence of oxygen, and hardly any pluricellular organism can survive. Exercise 13.4 Calculate the dioxygen concentration, at equilibrium with the atmosphere, dissolved in 10°C water in mg.L-1 The solubility of O2 in water as a function of temperature is calculated using the equation developped in Exercise 13.1. This is very simple as this consists in multiplying the DO concentration expressed in mol.L-1 by the molar weight (\\(MW_{O_2}\\)) of dioxygen: \\[\\begin{equation} [O_{2(aq)}] = K^{cp}_H(T_0).exp \\left[ \\left( \\frac {-\\Delta_{sol}H}{R} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{T} - \\frac{1}{T_0} \\right) \\right].P_{O_2}.MW_{O_2} \\end{equation}\\] The molar weight of oxygen is \\(MW_{O_2} = 2 \\times 16 = 32 \\space g.mol^{-1}\\). The partial pressure of O2 is 0.21 atm. The numerical application to calculate the dioxygen concentration dissolved in water at is thus: \\(K^{cp}_H(T_0) = 1.27 \\space 10^{-3} \\space mol.L^{-1}.atm^{-1}\\) \\(\\frac {-\\Delta_{sol}H}{R} = 1700°K\\) \\(P_{O_2} = 0.21 \\space atm\\) \\(MW_{O_2} = 32 \\space g.mol^{-1}\\) \\(T = 10°C\\), \\(T_0 = 25°C\\) \\[\\begin{equation} [O_{2(aq)}] = 1.27 \\space 10^{-3}exp \\left[ 1700\\left( \\frac{1}{10+273.15} - \\frac{1}{25+273.15} \\right) \\right] \\times 0.21 \\times 32 \\end{equation}\\] \\([O_{2(aq)}] = 11.5 \\space mg.L^{-1}\\) Table 13.2 consigns the DO concentrations for the range of temperature general found in natural waters. It is important to remember that between 5°C and 25°C, DO concentrations vary between about 13 and 8.5 mg.L-1 at equilibrium. Table 13.2 also shows that even in very warm waters (&gt;30°C), there should be plenty enough oxygen in water at equilibrium with the atmosphere to support life (DO &gt; 6 mg O2.L-1). In reality, for this type of temperatures, it is not rare to observe DO concentrations be much lower than that in streams overlying organic substrate… This suggests that that there are mechanisms at play lowering the DO concentrations, and that the apparent DO concentrations are the results of oxygen depleting (= oxygen demands) and oxygen replenishing (= oxygen supplies) processes.

So, pressure must have to do something with the amount of gases dissolved in water. In fact, the relationship with pressure is embedded in the Henry’s law! Before we get there, it is important to recall Dalton’s law or Dalton’s law of partial pressures (Dalton 1802) that states that in a mixture of non-reacting gases, the total pressure exerted is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases. In mathematical terms: \\[\\begin{equation} p_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{}{p_i} \\tag{13.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(p_i\\) is the partial pressure of each gase \\(i\\). The second part of Dalton’s law is that under small pressures (near 1 atm), the partial pressure of each gas can be calculated as \\(p_i = p_{total}.c_i\\) and \\(c_i\\) being the concentration of each gas \\(i\\). The concept of partial pressure was implied in the Henry’s law equation above (13.1), but is not properly defined At sea level, over 99.9% of dry atmospheric pressure can thus be expressed as \\[\\begin{equation} p_{total} \\approx p_{N_2} + p_{O_2} + p_{Ar} + p_{CO_2} \\\\ p_{gases(aq)} \\approx p_{N_2(aq)} + p_{O_2(aq)} + p_{Ar(aq)} + p_{CO_2(aq)} \\\\ [Dissolved \\space gases] \\approx C_{N_2(aq)} + C_{O_2(aq)} + C_{Ar(aq)} + C_{CO_2(aq)} \\\\ p_{total} \\approx 0.780840 + 0.209460 + 0.00934 + 0.000415 \\approx 1 \\space atm \\tag{13.4} \\end{equation}\\] This means that at equilibrium with the atmosphere, these four major gases are dissolved in pure water following Henry’s law, and that each gas has its own aqueous concentration. Again, at equilibrium with the atmosphere, the dissolved concentration of dioxygen at 10°C would be 11.5 mg.L-1 (Exercise 13.4). This means that when the DO concentration is equal to 11.5 mg.L-1, there is an equivalent partial pressure of 0.21 atm in the gaseous phase above the water. Because there is correspondance between dissolved concentration and pressure above the water, many authors also use the term partial pressure for the dissolved gas. Technically, this is incorrect and a better term should be gas tension (Colt 2012), as these gases are not in a gaseous phase but in an aqueous phase. But the beauty of this gas tension or partial pressure concept, is that at equilibrium with the atmosphere, the summation of these gas tensions is equal to 1 atm. And this summation can be directly compared to other pressures, including the barometric pressure and the water column pressure. You read it correctly, the summation of all the gas tensions in water is equal to 1 atm. How come, then, that all these gases are not bubbling up, all the time? Something must keep this gases from forming bubbles…? This means that the This chapter is still under construction References "],["SedWatInterface.html", "Chapter 14 Respiration kinetics at the sediment-water interface 14.1 The spatial scale of redox sequence in wetlands 14.2 Deriving of \\(O_2\\) microprofile equation in sediment 14.3 Equation of the downward flux at the sediment-water interface (10 points)", " Chapter 14 Respiration kinetics at the sediment-water interface Chapter summary: 14.1 The spatial scale of redox sequence in wetlands In Chapter 8 we presented the theoretical cascade of redox reactions in wetlands. The redox cascade was simplified in a series of well identified spatial zones in which an electron acceptor would be at play. It is the imbalance between the supply and demand of the electron acceptors that defined the zones themselves, and also the direction of concentration gradients and fluxes of electron acceptors and byproducts of respiration (see Figure 8.15). For illustration purposes, the depth and extent of each of the redox layer appeared the same and of several centimeter thick. But is that so, and does it matter? 14.2 Deriving of \\(O_2\\) microprofile equation in sediment The hypothesis given is that the volumetric respiration rates are constant, which means that the volumetric respiration rates are of zero order rates with respect to dioxygen in the water column. The dimensions of this rate are \\([M.L^{-3}.T^{-1}]\\). The instructions given are that the x axis is tilted upward, contrary to what was done in class. The method to derive this equation is to calculate a mass balance for an elementary volume of sediment. Let us take this elementary volume as being a straight parallelepiped of height \\(dx\\) and of flux surface area \\(A\\). This mass balance can be calculated two different ways. The mass \\(\\Delta M\\) of oxygen removed during \\(\\Delta t\\) is equal to the absolute difference in the downward flux of oxygen \\(J(x+dx)\\) at \\(x+dx\\) minus that \\(J(x)\\) at \\(x\\). The difference between what was done in class is that both \\(J(x+dx)\\) and \\(J(x)\\) are negative this time and the absolute value of \\(J(x+dx)\\) is greater than that \\(J(x)\\). So \\(\\Delta M\\), which must be positive, can be calculated as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta M = \\left[ J(x) - J(x+dx) \\right].A. \\Delta t \\end{equation}\\] This is opposite from what was done in class, where the axis was pointing downward. The mass of oxygen removed \\(\\Delta M\\) can also be calculated from the volumetric removal rate \\(R_0\\) during \\(\\Delta t\\) such that \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta M = R_0 . A . dx . \\Delta t \\end{equation}\\] Combining these two equations yields \\[\\begin{equation} \\left[J(x) - J(x+dx)\\right].A. \\Delta t = R_0 . A . dx . \\Delta t \\end{equation}\\] Rearranging the equation yields: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{J(x+dx) - J(x)}{dx} = -R_0 \\end{equation}\\] Interestingly, this expression is the same one as that seen in class. Taking the limit of this equation when \\(dx \\to 0\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\lim_{dx\\to 0} \\frac{J(x+dx) - J(x)}{dx} = -R_0 \\end{equation}\\] yields the derivative of the flux such that \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dJ}{dx} = -R_0 \\end{equation}\\] For the expression of the flux down, we use Fick’s law \\[\\begin{equation} J(x) = -D\\frac{dc}{dx} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\frac{dc}{dx}\\) is the \\(O_2\\) concentration (\\(c\\)) concentration gradient with respect to \\(x\\), and \\(D\\) is the diffusivity coefficient. The sign of this equation does not change regardless of the direction of \\(x\\). Indeed, for a positive \\(dx\\), the oxygen concentration increases, so \\(dc&gt;0\\). As a result, \\(\\frac{dc}{dx}&gt;0\\). As result, \\(-D\\frac{dc}{dx}&lt;0\\), i.e., \\(J(x)&lt;0\\), which is correct using this direction for the axis. The derivative of the flux can thus be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dJ}{dx} = -D\\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} \\end{equation}\\] Putting everything back together yields: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} = \\frac{R_0}{D} \\\\[7pt] \\end{equation}\\] Taking the integral a first time yields: \\[\\begin{equation} \\int_{}^{} \\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} = \\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{R_0}{D}x + a \\\\[7pt] \\end{equation}\\] and finally \\[\\begin{equation} c(x) = \\frac{R_0}{2D}x^2 + ax +b \\\\[7pt] \\end{equation}\\] where \\(a,b,c\\) are variables to be determined. To do so, one looks at the conditions at the boundaries. At \\(x=0\\), \\(c(0) = c_0\\), hence \\(b = c_0\\). At depth \\(x = L\\) (\\(L\\) is negative here because the x axis is reversed), both \\(c(L) = 0\\), and, \\(\\frac{dc}{dx}(L) = 0\\) because the profile is a parabola. One can thus write, using the derivative \\(\\frac{dc}{dx}(L) = 0\\) at the boundary: \\[\\begin{equation} 0 = \\frac{R_0}{D}L + a \\\\[7pt] or \\\\[7pt] a = -\\frac{R_0}{D}L \\end{equation}\\] Using \\(c(L) = 0\\) boundary condition: \\[\\begin{equation} 0 = \\frac{R_0}{2D}L^2 - \\frac{R_0}{D}L^2 + c_0 \\\\[7pt] or \\\\[7pt] 0 = -\\frac{R_0}{2D}L^2 + c_0\\\\[7pt] and \\\\[7pt] \\frac{R_0}{2D}L^2 = c_0 \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} L^2 = \\frac{2c_0D}{R_0}\\\\[7pt] and \\\\[7pt] L = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2c_0D}{R_0}} \\end{equation}\\] Because \\(L\\) is negative. Thus \\[\\begin{equation} a = -\\frac{R_0}{D} \\times -\\sqrt{\\frac{2c_0D}{R_0}}\\\\[7pt] a = \\sqrt{\\frac{2c_0R_0}{D}}\\\\[7pt] \\end{equation}\\] Hence the final equation \\[\\begin{equation} \\boxed{ c(x) = \\frac{R_0}{2D}x^2 +\\sqrt{\\frac{2c_0R_0}{D}}x +c_0 \\\\[7pt] } \\end{equation}\\] It is possible to verify the answer by replacing \\(x\\) in the equation derived in class by \\(-x\\). 14.3 Equation of the downward flux at the sediment-water interface (10 points) The general expression of the flux down is given by Fick’s law: \\[\\begin{equation} J(x) = -D\\frac{dc}{dx} \\end{equation}\\] From the equation of \\(c(x)\\), one can calculate the derivative of \\(c(x)\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{R_0}{D}x +\\sqrt{\\frac{2c_0R_0}{D}} \\end{equation}\\] Hence: \\[\\begin{equation} J(x) = -R_0x -\\sqrt{2c_0R_0D} \\end{equation}\\] The downward flux of oxygen at the sediment water interface, which one may call Sediment Oxygen Demand (SOD), corresponds to \\(J(x=0)\\). \\[\\begin{equation} \\boxed{ SOD= -\\sqrt{2c_0R_0D} } \\end{equation}\\] As expected, the flux is negative compared to the direction of the axis. This verification confirms the result obtained. Figure 14.1: Dioxygen and nitrate concentrations at the sediment water interface in the case of zero order respiration rates in the sediment. The area of the colored rectangles are a graphical representation of the downward fluxes of oxygen and nitrate in the sediment. The value of the nitrate concentration at the interface between the aerobic and denitrification zones has been added, as well as the value of the oxygen (Sediment Oxygen Demand - SOD) and nitrate (JNO3) downward fluxes in the sediment expressed in common reported units.

The beginning of this paragraph mentions time series. Indeed, in hydrology we no longer measure flow on a continuous basis, but rather at a given frequency. From the late 1880s to the early 1980s though, hydrographs were, always at the beginning and, in many cases later on, automatically drawn on paper by a scribing pen on a roll of paper. These would move relative to the other as a function of the variable stage of the nearby stream or river, thereby creating a true continuous record of stage variations or a continuous hydrograph. Nowadays, however, the vast majority not to say all of the hydrological data are collected by electronic equipment at a given time interval and logged on memory chips at a given logging interval. Thanks to hydrological instruments, we have been able to make measurements of river stages continuously or at a near continuous pace, i.e., at a high frequency (hourly or smaller), for nearly 150 years. From this high frequency data, it has been possible to calculate flow rates and obtain a visual representation of typical variations of flow following a rainfall event. It is important to recognize here that while water stage can be measured, flow rates are always calculated. The first example below is an example of what we refer to as a simple hydrograph, which follows a rainfall event, with an initial baseflow, a rapidly rising limb, a flow peak, and a more slowly falling limb. hydgph&lt;-read.csv(file = &quot;hydgph.csv&quot;, header = TRUE) names(hydgph)=c(&quot;date&quot;,&quot;Q&quot;,&quot;NO3&quot;) date=as.POSIXct(hydgph$date, format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;) # transforms the first column of the file, which are characters into dates that R understands Q=hydgph$Q*1000 # Puts in the variable Q the flow rates, which are orginally in m³/s to L/s for better visualization par(mar=c(4.5,4.5,0.5,0.5)) xlimHG=as.POSIXct(c(&quot;1999-01-03 00:00:00&quot;,&quot;1999-01-08 00:00:00&quot;));ylimHG=c(50,350) # this defines the plotting ranges for the x and y axes plot(date,Q,xlab = &quot;date&quot;,ylab = &quot;Flow rate (L/s)&quot;,type = &quot;p&quot;,col=&quot;blue&quot;,xlim=xlimHG,ylim=ylimHG) # this plots the hydrograph Although the points are disjointed, it is very tempting to add a line between them, as our observations and intuitions tell us that there is a pattern of flow up or down, and in this example, the time interval between consecutive values is 600 seconds or 10 min. And indeed, this is exactly what hydrologists do, we add lines between points as an approximation of what flow must have looked like during the measurement intervals. The same data plotted without the measurement points looks like the figure below, appears continuous, although it is not! 16.1.1 Characteristics of a hydrograph A hydrograph is characterized by a fast rising limb, and a slower falling limb. This is the typical response of flow following a rainfall event. The time it takes to go from the beginning of what we refer to as an event to the peak is called time of rise. The maximum of the flow rate is referred to as peakflow. In quantitative hydrology, one major end goal is to predict what might be peak flows for a given return period. This is necessary to size and design structures such as pipes, culverts, bridges, or to predict the rise of water level and extent of potential flooding in an area. On the water quality side of hydrology, flow peaks are not the main focus. Rather, the timing of and the cumulative nutrient loads are the focus. As such, the volume of water generated during a hydrological event is central, which suggests that the entire hydrograph is of interest, not just the flow peak. Obviously the quality of the water, or the concentrations of nutrients and pollutants, matters very much, and this will be detailed below. 16.1.2 Actual hydrograph over an entire year The goal of the first part above was to realize that there is no such thing as continuous data, but that really all data around the world is an assemblage of discontinuous data points. In the case of hydrological data, all points are auto-correlated, and provided that flow be measured frequently enough, then a linear interpolation between consecutive points is just fine. Now, let us explore what a typical yearly hydrograph of a watershed in a temperate climate where snow does not play a significant role. The conventional acronym for flow rates is the letter Q. data&lt;-read.csv(file=&quot;sample_1hr_QC_data.csv&quot;,header = TRUE) #Reads file into table format WSarea&lt;-24.2 #Area of watershed in km2 WS&lt;-&quot;Maudouve at Saint-Donan, France&quot; names(data)=c(&quot;datetime&quot;,&quot;Q&quot;,&quot;C&quot;) # renames the columns in simpler names data&lt;-as.data.frame(data) data$datetime&lt;-as.POSIXct(strptime(data$datetime, &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;)) # transforms characters into date values understood by R D&lt;-data$datetime Q&lt;-data$Q #Defines Q as the flow value (m3/s) N=nrow(data) #Sets N to the value equal to the number of total rows in the table # definition of the x and y axes limits startdate&lt;-D[1] enddate&lt;-D[N] xlim = as.POSIXct(c(startdate,enddate)) # this renders the first and last date understandable for plotting purposes ylimQ = c(0,max(Q)) # ylim for flow ScaleF = 1.2 # scaling factor for size of fonts and other things y1lab&lt;-expression(&quot;Flow rate (&quot; * m^3 * &quot;/s)&quot;) # defines the label for flow par(mar=c(4.5,4.5,4,4.5)) # defines the sizes, in number of lines, for the margins (bottom, left, top, right) ltyp=c(1,2) plot(D,Q,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylimQ) # we are taking all the default addition of axis tick marks and numbers out by using xaxt and yaxt = &quot;n&quot; # and setting the axis labels at nothing using xlab = &quot;&quot; and ylab = &quot;&quot; abline(h=0) abline(v=seq(startdate, enddate, by=&quot;week&quot;),col=(&quot;grey&quot;)) axis.POSIXct(1, at=seq(startdate, enddate, by=&quot;month&quot;), format=&quot;%m/%d&quot;,cex.axis=ScaleF) # this tells R that we want the X axis ticks and values to be displayed as dates, be added on a monthly basis, # using the month/day format axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) # this tells R that the first Y axis ticks can be displayed (that function was repressed earlier by &#39;yaxt=&quot;n&quot; &#39;) par(new=TRUE) # this tells R that a new plot has already been opened, in other words you are telling R to keep adding things # on the existing plot mtext(&quot;Dates in 1997-1998&quot;,side=1,line=3,cex=ScaleF) # add in the margin the defined labels and title mtext(y1lab,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) mtext(WS,side=3,line=1.5,cex=ScaleF) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;,c(&quot;Flow&quot;),lty = c(1), col = c(&quot;blue&quot;)) Notice that one can see individual hydrographs characterized for the rapid rise of flow rates, followed by a rapid fall. But they seem to occur on top of a transient minimum flow rate. The latter is called baseflow. It corresponds to the stream water exclusively fed by groundwater. You can see in this example that there is very low baseflow from September 1st to the 3rd week of October. A large event around that time raises the baseflow to about 250 L/s and this stays almost stable until the end of the third week of December. This is the time when most of the rainfall starts in this part of the world and heavy rainfall last until the middle of January. The baseflow during these 1.5 months rose above 600 L/s. It took about an entire month with nearly no rainfall from the last week of January to the last week of Febraury for baseflow to go down to the pre-December values. Baseflow stays at that general level between the last week of February to the first week of April. Then a series of large rainfall events raise the baseflow back to high levels throughout the month of April. Again, it takes again about one month for baseflow to decrease and then stay stable throughout the month of June. In July and August, even a relative large event at the end of the first week of July does not raise the baseflow level, which steadily disminishes until the beginning of September. 16.1.3 Calculating water fluxes or cumulative flow volumes Flow peaks matter very much for flooding issues and an entire domain of hydrology and statistical hydrology is devoted to calculating and predicting flow peaks generating floods. For water quality purposes, flow volumes matter just as much as flow peaks do. Indeed, the amount or load of pollutants leaving a field or a watershed, or delivered in a receiving water body, depends on the total volume of water, and, on the concentrations. Flow volumes or cumulative flows, correspond to the cumulative volume of water that has passed at a particular point over a given period. Mathematically, this means that flow volumes correspond to the integral over time of the instantaneous flow rates. or \\[ CumulQ = \\int_{}^{period}{Q(t).dt} \\] In practice, because the instantaneous flow rates are discrete in time, \\[ CumulQ = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{\\frac{(Q_i + Q_{i+1})}{2}}.time \\space interval \\] If we zoom on a hypothetical hydrograph named TS (time series), this corresponds to cumulating the area under each trapeze represented below. par(mar=c(4.5,4.5,0.5,0.5)) x&lt;-1:10 TS&lt;-25-(x-5)^2+2;xlim=c(0,11);ylim=c(0,30) plot(x,TS,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim) date&lt;-as.character(date) # need to transfer dates back into character to make some operations polygx&lt;-cbind(head(x,-1),head(x,-1),x[-1],x[-1],head(x,-1)) # x values of the polygons polygy&lt;-cbind(rep(0,length(TS)-1),head(TS,-1),TS[-1],rep(0,length(TS)-1),rep(0,length(TS)-1)) # y values of the polygons for (j in 1:(length(TS)-1)){polygon((as.vector(polygx[j,])),as.vector(polygy[j,]),col=&quot;lightblue&quot;)} date&lt;-as.POSIXct(date) par(new=TRUE) plot(x,TS,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim) One could calculate the cumulative flow by adding over time the area under each trapeze at in the example below. The result of this mock unitless ‘hydrograph’ are displayed underneath. cumTS_inst=matrix(0,10,1) # 10 values, the first one being 0 to associate to initial time for (i in 1:9){QQ=(TS[i]+TS[i+1])/2;cumTS_inst[i+1]=cumTS_inst[i]+QQ} as.vector(cumTS_inst) ## [1] 0.0 14.5 35.0 59.5 86.0 112.5 137.0 157.5 172.0 178.5 It turns out that in R, there is a very smart and simple way to calculate cumulative flow, loads, etc. of a time series (TS here) using the code below: time_interval=1 c(0,(cumsum(TS[-1])+cumsum(head(TS,-1)))/2)*time_interval ## [1] 0.0 14.5 35.0 59.5 86.0 112.5 137.0 157.5 172.0 178.5 The magic comes the function cumsum() which calculates the cumulative sum of a vector and generates a vector of the same length of the original one: cumsum(c(1,2,1,2,1,2)) ## [1] 1 3 4 6 7 9 and the fact that each trapeze is the average of two rectangles represented below: par(mar=c(4.5,4.5,0.5,0.5)) plot(x,TS,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim) suprectxy=cbind(1:9,rep(0,9),2:10,TS[2:10]) infrectxy=cbind(1:9,rep(0,9),2:10,TS[1:9]) for (i in 1:9){rect(infrectxy[i,1],infrectxy[i,2],infrectxy[i,3],infrectxy[i,4],col = transpblue)} for (i in 1:9){rect(suprectxy[i,1],suprectxy[i,2],suprectxy[i,3],suprectxy[i,4],col = transpred)} Let us apply this method to the Maudouve hydrograph plotted earlier. Calculating the cumulative flow corresponds to integrating under the hydrograph curve, as represented by the grey area on the left panel. The corresponding cumulative flow, expressed in mm is plotted on the right side of the plots. par(mfrow = c(3,2));par(mar=c(4.5,5,0.5,0.5)) xlim = as.POSIXct(c(startdate,enddate)) n=c(2500,4500,N) for (i in 1:3){ plot(0,0,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylimQ) abline(h=0) axis.POSIXct(1, at=seq(startdate, enddate, by=&quot;month&quot;), format=&quot;%m/%d&quot;,cex.axis=ScaleF) axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) polygon(c(D[1:n[i]],D[n[i]:1]),c(Q[1:n[i]],rep(0,n[i])),col=&quot;grey&quot;) par(new=TRUE) plot(D,Q,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylimQ) mtext(&quot;Dates in 1997-1998&quot;,side=1,line=3,cex=ScaleF) # add in the margin the defined labels and title mtext(y1lab,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) cumQ=c(0,(cumsum(Q[-1])+cumsum(head(Q,-1)))/2)*3600/WSarea/1000 # calculates in mm the cumulative flow for each time stamp plot(D[1:n[i]],cumQ[1:n[i]],col=&quot;red&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=c(0,cumQ[N])) abline(h=0) abline(h=seq(0,1000,by=50),lty=2,col=&quot;lightgrey&quot;) axis.POSIXct(1, at=seq(startdate, enddate, by=&quot;month&quot;), format=&quot;%m/%d&quot;,cex.axis=ScaleF) axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) par(new=TRUE) mtext(&quot;Dates in 1997-1998&quot;,side=1,line=3,cex=ScaleF) # add in the margin the defined labels and title mtext(&quot;Cumulative Flow volume (mm)&quot;,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) } print(signif(max(cumQ),digits = 3)) # displays the final cumulative flow value in m3 ## [1] 378 Figure 16.1: Video illustrating the calculation of cumulative volume by integrating under a hydrograph. Notice that the two high flow periods in January and April participate in a large proportion of the total cumulative volume Notice that most of the increase of the cumulative flow occurs during the January and April periods described above. 16.1.4 Evaluating the importance of rare high flow events: flow duration curves 16.1.4.1 Sorting flow and load values Flow occurs permanent streams throughout the year, but with bursts following rainfall events, which are, in most places on earth relatively rare. For example, in North Carolina, it rains about 7% of the time. Most of the flow occurs after these rare occurrences. The idea behind the duration curve concept is to characterize the importance of high flow events in the overall volume of water generated. Flow duration curves represent the percentage of the total flow that occurred in x% of the time corresponding to the highest flows. The same applies for loads. This might sound a bit murky, but hopefully it will not with the further explanations below. To get there, one first needs to order flow and loads in descending order. QSort=sort(Q,decreasing = TRUE) #Sorts instantaneous flow rates in descending order One can also calculate the cumulative flow associated with the sorted instantaneous flow rates as follows: cumQSort&lt;-c(0,(cumsum(QSort[-1])+cumsum(head(QSort,-1)))/2)*3600/WSarea/1000 cumQSortPerc&lt;-cumQSort/tail(cumQSort,1)*100 The blue hydrograph from above now becomes: par(mar=c(4.5,4.5,1,1)) plot(1:length(QSort),QSort,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,ylim=ylimQ) abline(h=0) axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) mtext(y1lab,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) mtext(&quot;Cumulative number of flow values&quot;,side=1,line=3,cex=ScaleF) legend(&quot;topright&quot;,c(&quot;Sorted Flow&quot;),lty = c(1), col = c(&quot;blue&quot;)) So now the cumulative flow volume curve corresponding to the highest flow rates as a function, not of time anymore but of the cumulative number of flow values looks like this: par(mar=c(4.5,5.5,1,1)) plot(cumQSortPerc,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;, ylim=c(0,100)) abline(h=0) axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) mtext(&quot;Cumulative number of flow values&quot;,side=1,line=1,cex=ScaleF) mtext(&quot;%age of cumulative flow corresponding to\\n the highest sorted flow rates &quot;,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) # the \\n in the text allows for line break in the title This corresponds to the integration under the curve of the sorted hydrograph as in: par(mfrow = c(3,2));par(mar=c(4.5,5,0.5,0.5)) xlim = as.POSIXct(c(startdate,enddate)) n=c(2500,4500,N) for (i in 1:3){ plot(0,0,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=c(1,length(Q)),ylim=ylimQ) abline(h=0) axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) polygon(c(1:n[i],n[i]:1),c(QSort[1:n[i]],rep(0,n[i])),col=&quot;grey&quot;) par(new=TRUE) plot(1:length(QSort),QSort,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=c(1,length(Q)),ylim=ylimQ) mtext(y1lab,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) plot(1:n[i],cumQSort[1:n[i]],col=&quot;red&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=c(1,length(Q)),ylim=c(0,cumQ[N])) abline(h=0) abline(h=seq(0,1000,by=50),lty=2,col=&quot;lightgrey&quot;) axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) par(new=TRUE) mtext(&quot;Cumulative Flow volume (mm)&quot;,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) } Notice that the cumulative sorted flow curve does not have the two large increases observed for the months of January and April anymore because all flows are sorted in decreasing order, regardless of when they occurred. Notice that there is still no unit added for the x axis because I decided that the cumulative number of flow value does not really add a lot to the analysis. However, it becomes very interesting to transform these values in probability of occurrence. Each value has 1/N the probability to occur. We can also calculate the cumulative probability of occurrence of flow values. Flow and load duration curves are thus derived this way. 16.1.5 Flow duration curves as flow exceedance curves The previous curves give the semi-continuous duration curves. In practice, we like to use discrete values or percentages to express ourselves. In other words, to characterize the importance of high flow in the generation of flow volume in a watershed, we like to say something like “50% of the flow in that watershed occurred in 10% of the time, corresponding to the highest flow”. This provides a way of demonstrating of how relatively flashy the watershed may be, either relatively to other watersheds or to previous years. The flashiness of a watershed refers to how rapidly flow is altered as a result of storm events/varying conditions. More frequent spikes in flow in response to precipitation events, in which flow increases and decreases more greatly and rapidly, are typically indicative of watersheds with predominant portions of streamflow being influenced by surface runoff, a quicker responding contributor of water to streamflow. Practically, one can associate to each cumulative sorted discharge value a percentage of the total discharge yielding Wk% values (W for Water volume) corresponding to the kth cumulative probability of the time elapsed, with k being an integer. This corresponds to discretize the continuous curves above to 100 points. Practically this can be calculated like this: Wk=quantile(cumQSort,probs=seq(0.01,1,0.01))/tail(cumQSort,1) #Calculates and assigns Wk% values to a probability occurring in 1-100% of the total time and the discretized flow duration curve is illustrated below: xlim=c(0,100);ylim=c(0,100); plot(1:100,Wk*100,xlab=&quot;Prob of Occurrence %&quot;,ylab=&quot;Mk% &amp; Wk%&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim,pch=21,col=&quot;black&quot;,bg=&quot;blue&quot;) par(new=TRUE) # plot(1:100,Mk*100,xlab=&quot;Prob of Occurrence %&quot;,ylab=&quot;Mk% &amp; Wk%&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim,pch=22,col=&quot;black&quot;,bg=ColElmt) # par(new=TRUE) abline(1,1,col=&quot;black&quot;,lty=&quot;dashed&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim) par(new=TRUE) legend(&quot;bottomright&quot;,c(&quot;Cumul Q&quot;,&quot;Cumul NO3 load&quot;), pch=c(19), col=c(&quot;blue&quot;), bg=&quot;white&quot;) title(main=&quot;Nitrate Load and flow duration curves&quot;) # the \\n in the text allows for line break in the title One can then easily report that, for example, in 10% of the time corresponding to the highest flows, 41% of the flow occurred using this signif(Wk[10]*100,digits = 2)% code. This watershed is thus relatively flashy as about 41% of its total flow volume occurs in 10% of the time. Now, the interesting part of the curve is what happens for the low probability of occurrence because in this analysis, it corresponds to the highest flow. When one adds several curves on the same graph, it become difficult to distinguish the curves together. One way around that is to use log scale of the same graph using the code below. #Code for plotting the double cumulative plot using the normal distribution probabilities to zoom in on the lower tails v&lt;-c(1,2,3,5,10,25,50,75,90,95,97,98,99,100) #v is a set of user defined values of percentages of the total time to be used for calculating and plotting specific corresponding Wk% and Mk% values x&lt;-v/100 #Sets x as values of v in percentages # y&lt;-Mk[v] #Sets y as the set of Mk% values corresponding with percentages of the total time defined by values in x xx&lt;-qnorm(x) #qnorm takes a given probability (x values in this case) and returns the corresponding cumulative distribution value (Z-score) based on a normal distribution curve # yy&lt;-qnorm(y) #Here, qnorm is taking the percentages of the load that occur associated with percentages of the total time defined by values in x and calculating associated Z-scores according to a normal distribution curve yV&lt;-Wk[v] #Sets yV as the set of Wk% values corresponding with percentages of the total time defined by values in x yyV&lt;-qnorm(yV) #qnorm takes percentages of the flow occurring associated with percentages of the total time defined by x values and assigns Z-score values to each probability based on the normal distribution curve # yy&lt;-cbind(yy,yyV) #Binds both sets of Z-score values corresponding with Mk% (yy) and Wk% (yV) xx&lt;-cbind(xx,xx) #Binds both sets of Z-scores correspdonding with defined percentages of the total time (They are the same, this is for plotting purposes) # color&lt;-c(ColElmt,&quot;blue&quot;) #Defines the plot colors for yy and yV color&lt;-c(&quot;blue&quot;) #Defines the plot colors for yy and yV plot(xx[,1],yyV,xlab=&quot;Probability of Occurrence (%)&quot;,ylab=&quot;Wk%&quot;, type=&quot;o&quot;,xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlim=c(-2.5,2.5),ylim=c(-2.5,2.5),pch=19,col=color) #Plots yy and yV values as a function of xx values par(new=TRUE) axis(1,at=xx[,1],labels=x*100) axis(2,at=xx[,1],labels=x*100) title(main=&quot;Double cumulative probability plot for flow volume&quot;) # the \\n in the text allows for line break in the title abline(h=xx,lty=3,col=&quot;grey&quot;) #Plots gridlines abline(v=xx,lty=3,col=&quot;grey&quot;) legend(&quot;bottomright&quot;,c(&quot;Cumul Q&quot;), pch=1, col=color, bg=&quot;white&quot;) 16.2 Chemographs and concentration levels With rapid changes in flow during events, concentrations vary just as well. This has remained pretty much hidden to most people until the 1980s because there was no easy way to measure water quality at the pace at which flow rates were measured. Since then instruments have been able to capture concentrations at a pace equal or close to that of flow monitoring. The curve that plots the variations of concentrations with flow is referred to as a chemograph. The nitrate annual chemograph for the Maudouve watershed presented above is illustrated below. data&lt;-read.csv(file=&quot;sample_1hr_QC_data.csv&quot;,header = TRUE) #Reads file into table format WSarea&lt;-24.2 #Area of watershed in km2 WS&lt;-&quot;Maudouve at Saint-Donan, France&quot;

It varies opposite to flow variations, with the concentrations appearing relatively all the more diluted that flow is high. This is referred to as a dilution effect. Let us pause for a second and find other indicators of concentration over that the hydrograph period. It is easy to calculate the average or the median concentration over the four days selected here. The arithmetic average concentration can be calculated in the text using signif(mean(C),3), which yields 14.4 mg N/L. Similarly the median concentration is 14.8 mg N/L. These values are about three times the nitrate concentration values that I ask you to remember for most agricultural water: 5 mg N/L. This is because Brittany in France is a very intensive agricultural area where the denitrification capacities in watersheds are not quite as high as those observed in North Carolina for example. The level of concentration does give the general pollution level. But more interestingly, it allows to calculate pollutant loads, or the mass of pollutants that flows by a particular station. Instantaneous loads correspond to the mass of pollutant flowing per unit time at a station and its dimensions are [M.T-1]. Instantaneous loads for pollutants are the equivalent of flow rates for water. They are calculated as the product of flow by concentrations \\[ L(t) = Q(t).C(t) \\] Cumulative loads correspond to the cumulative mass of pollutants that has flowed by a station over a given period of time, and are the equivalent of cumulative flow volume for water. \\[ CumulLoad = \\int_{}^{period}{L(t).dt} = \\int_{}^{period}{Q(t).C(t).dt} \\] One can calculate the cumulative load of nitrate over the three days of record above using the following code: cumulLoad&lt;-c(0,(cumsum(L[-1])+cumsum(head(L,-1)))/2)*3600/1000 tail(cumulLoad,1) ## [1] 839.0834 So this means that over these 4 days, 839 kg N were discharged at that particular station. That is quite a bit!! In most stations around the world, however, to this day, researchers and water agencies do not have access to the continuous chemograph, but they are still trying to calculate loads. Because most stations do have continuous water flow measurements, one can use this information to calculate loads. Technically, the load calculated above for these 4 days can be calculated by multiplying the flow volume over these four days by the flow-weighted concentration (FWC) value. FWC in our example can be calculated as: \\[ FWC = \\frac{CumulLoad}{CumulQ} \\] cumulQ&lt;-c(0,(cumsum(Q[-1])+cumsum(head(Q,-1)))/2)*3600/1000 FWC&lt;-tail(cumulLoad,1)/tail(cumulQ,1) FWC ## [1] 12.91443 The FWC in our case here is 12.9 mg N/L, which quite a bit lower than the arithmetic average. This is expected as during the highest flows, the concentrations tend to be diluted. But in reality, people do not have access to the FWC, so one has to best estimate concentration. There are many different ways, all of which wrong, to estimate these FWC. One is to use the arithmetic average concentration as an estimate. By doing so, one obtains for an estimate of the load over this period using signif(mean(C)*tail(cumulQ,1),3), i.e., 937 kg, that is 12% more than the actual one. Let us now look at other datasets, that is data from the Cuyahoga River at Independence in Ohio. We are observing the same dilution effect pattern with nitrate for the Cuyahoga river. If we look at the TP concentrations, the concentrations increase with flow rates. This is referred to as a concentration effect. In fact the TP concentration peak is a little ahead of the flow peak in this particular case. ## [1] 30327.93 ## [1] 0.374828 The arithmetic average concentration for TP on these 8 days are 0.335 mg P/L. The FWC for TP for these 8 days is 0.374828 mg P/L, that is 11% more than the arithmetic average ones. This means that using the arithmetic average concentration to calculate loads will, for nutrients that have a concentration effect, underestimate loads.

As a result, it tends to trace quantities in nature When dissolved in water, and depending on the pH of the solution, ammonia converts to ammonium following the reaction: \\[ H_2O + NH_3 \\rightleftharpoons OH^{-} + NH_4^{+} \\] Production: Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals. Dozens of chemical plants worldwide produce ammonia. Consuming more than 1% of all man-made power, ammonia production is a significant component of the world energy budget. In 2014, about 88% of the ammonia produced was used for fertilizing agricultural crops Modern ammonia-producing plants generally depend on the Haber-Bosch process which consists into reducing dinitrogen into ammonia \\[ 3\\,H_2 + N_2 \\to 2\\,NH_3 \\] Consumption: Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen-containing compounds. Virtually all synthetic nitrogen compounds are derived from ammonia. back to top 17.1.4 Ammonium Ammonium is the most reduced inorganic nitrogenous cation (positively charged). Ammonium 3D shape: Lewis dot structure: Number of electron N has for itself following electronegativity rule: eight It is formed by the protonation of ammonia following the reaction: \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O + NH_3 \\rightleftharpoons OH^{-} + NH_4^{+} \\tag{17.1} \\end{equation}\\] The relative abundance of ammonium vs ammonia depends on the pH of the solution. See figure below Because in most natural aqueous environments, pH is below 8, ammonium tends to be the preponderant form. Production: In nature, ammonium is a waste product of the mineralization of organic molecules It is added as fertilizer on soils as ammonium nitrate Health hazard: Ammonia vapor has a sharp, irritating, pungent odor that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death Drinking water standard: back to top 17.1.5 Ammonium nitrate Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound, the nitrate salt of the ammonium cation It is a white crystal solid and is highly soluble in water. Formula: \\(NH_4NO_3\\) 3D shape: It is predominantly used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer Its other major use is as a component of explosive mixtures used in mining, quarrying, and civil construction Production: Ammonium nitrate does exist naturally in mines of the Atacama desert in Chile but globally nearly all ammonium nitrate is now produced synthetically Byproduct of all respiration processes. Ammonium ions are a waste product of the metabolism of animals. In fish and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the urea cycle to urea, because urea is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into uric acid, which is solid and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss. Consumption/utilization: It is used as a fertilizer, because it tends to release inorganic nitrogen slowly in soil. Applied as a surface fertilizer, it penetrates the soil with rainfall infiltration. Highly soluble, the nitrate anion becomes readily available to plant roots, although it is susceptible to leaching below the root system into the shallow and deep groundwater. The ammonium cation tends to adsorb to soil particles and is thus not as susceptible to leaching. Ammonium can be directly uptaken by plant roots, which thermodynamically makes sense, although because in most soils aerobic conditions are preponderant, nitrate tends to be the ion uptaken most often. Soil bacteria in the aerobic zone of the soil will oxidize adsorbed ammonium into nitrate, which then becomes available for plant roots. The whole chain of events slows the release of inorganic nitrogen to crops and thus makes for more effective fertilizers.

Benthic sediment losely corresponds to the layer where life micro- and macroorganisms are present. The organisms living in this zone are referred to as benthos. 17.3 C 17.3.1 Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide is a colorless gas which density is 50% higher than that of dry air. Formula: CO2 Carbon dioxide 3D shape: Lewis dot structure: Number of electron C has for itself following electronegativity rule: zero CO2 can only be an electron acceptor Production: oxidation of C in all organic molecules Almost all respiratory processes on earth (some respiration does not involve oxidation of C) Combustion of all Carbon-based fuel Consumption: Photosynthesis Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the primary carbon source for life on Earth Calcite precipitation in the oceans Ecological Significance: Greenhouse Gas, which serves as reference for all other GHG Concentration in the atmosphere ~380 ppm on the rise, or 0.38%, or a partial pressure of 0.38 atm Carbon Dioxide variations through ancient and modern times concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from hundreds of thousands of years ago through 2015, measured in parts per million (ppm). The data come from a variety of historical ice core studies and recent air monitoring sites around the world. Each line represents a different data source (EPA 2016) Zooming in even more over the last few years and predictions, the Met Office in London predicted in early 2020 the continuous rise of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Carbon Dioxide variations from 2015 to 2021 In reality, concentrations are not stable, and vary widely in time and in space at the next two videos nicely show. The next one results from the model simulations Youtube video of CO2 modeled seasonal variations - The following one is the combination of both models and observations Youtube video of CO2 modeled and observed seasonal variations back to top 17.3.2 Carbonates After carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it will combine with water to form carbonic acid (\\(H_2CO_3\\)). Carbonate serves as the carbon source for aquatic vegetation Carbonic acid can then dissociate into bicarbonate (\\(HCO_3^-\\)) and carbonate (\\(CO_3^{2-}\\)) The term “bicarbonate” was coined in 1814 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston. The prefix “bi” in “bicarbonate” comes from an outdated naming system and is based on the observation that there is twice as much carbonate (CO32−) per sodium ion in sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and other bicarbonates than in sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and other carbonates. The name lives on as a trivial name. (Wikipedia contributors 2018a). \\[\\begin{align} H_2CO_3 &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; HCO_3^- + H^+ \\tag{17.2} \\\\ HCO_3^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; CO_3^{2-} + H^+ \\tag{17.3} \\end{align}\\] In an environment not open to the atmosphere (or where direct exchange with the atmosphere is very limited like in stream or wetland sediment), the preponderant form depends on the pH and can be calculated as illustrated on the graph below. Carbon dioxide and carbonates are fully oxidized forms of inorganic molecules with just one atom of C: the carbon atom has zero electrons for itself as shown in Figure 17.1 Figure 17.1: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of C, including from left to right CO2, carbonic acid, hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate), and carbonate, showing that the C atoms have no electrons for themselves In sea water, Carbonate can combine with Ca2+ to form Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3), which precipitates out of solution. In other words, calcium carbonate formation is a sink for carbonate, and ultimately from CO2 addition from the atmosphere to to increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Carbonates are thus a great pH buffer in aquatic environments 17.3.3 Catabolism Reactions involving the breaking down of organic substrates, typically by oxidative breakdown, to provide chemically available energy (e.g. A TP) and/or to generate metabolic intermediates used in subsequent anabolic reactions (De Bolster 1997). Synonyms: Aerobic and anaerobic respirations which use organic molecules as electron donors, are synonyms of catabolism. In soil science another synonym of catabolism is mineralization, which refers to the decomposition or oxidation of the chemical compounds in organic matter releasing the nutrients contained in those compounds into soluble inorganic forms that may be plant-accessible (Wikipedia contributors 2018d). 17.4 D 17.4.1 Denitrification The microbially mediated dissimilatory reduction of nitrate into dinitrogen see denitrification in chapters for more details 17.4.2 Dihydrogen sulfide see hydrogen sulfide back to top 17.5 E 17.5.1 Electron Donating Group (EDG) and Electron Withdrawing Group (EWG) To explain some of the substitution reactions observed on aromatic rings, chemists have come up with a theory on how functional groups tend to either attract electrons away from the arene ring, (Electron Withdrawing Groups - EWG), and thereby deactivating the aromatic ring for further substitution reactions, or, conversely, to donate electrons to the aromatic ring (Electron Donating Group - EDG), thereby activating the aromatic ring to allow further substitution reactions. In reality, chemists have identified that EDG and EWG result from two processes, acting in concert or opposite to each other: the inductive effect, and the resonance effect or mesomerism effect The inductive effect is very much associated with the electronegativity of atoms and groups. Groups that contain oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, all more electronegative than carbon or hydrogen, will have a tendency to attract electrons for themselves, relative to the carbon and hydrogen of the aromatic ring. We have seen that for individual atoms, oxygen tends to ‘steal’ all electrons from all other atoms; that nitrogen and sulfur tend to steal electrons from carbon and hydrogen, and that carbon tends to steal electrons from hydrogen atoms. So, for example, functional groups like the amino group (-NH2), the hydroxyl group (-OH), the sulfanyl group (-SH), or the methoxyl group (-OCH3) can have electronegative atoms directly bonded to a carbon of the aromatic ring. The electronegativity of these groups would result in a tendency to withdraw electrons from the aromatic ring. The type of electronic effect is noted -I (the minus standing for withdrawing and I for inductive). Now, entire functional groups such as the carboxyl group (-COOH), the aldehyde (-CHO), carbonyl (-C=O, e.g., in a ketone group), or the nitro group (-NO2, the latter being rather rare in nature), are, overall, more electronegative than carbon and hydrogen from an arene ring, and can too behave like an overall electronegative group that tends to attract electrons to themselves. These group would also result in a tendency to withdraw electrons from the aromatic ring. They too would have a negative inductive effect referred to as -I. A group like methyl (-CH3) is almost neutral compared to the other carbon atoms of the aromatic ring and has no inductive effect. Only two groups would result in a tendency to donate electrons to the aromatic ring, and it is because they have too many electrons to start with, and these would be the oxido group (-O-) and the carboxylate group (-COO-). The resonance effect has to do with the ability of conjugated double bonds or lone pairs of electrons to move about and to be stabilized by electronic resonance. In Figure 17.2, the carboxyl and the nitro groups tend to attract electrons from the aromatic ring by resonance because they have a π bond with the electronegative atom oxygen (-C=O and -N=O in carboxyl and nitro groups). As a result, their electronic effect by resonance results in a tendency to withdraw electrons from the aromatic ring. In this case, the electronic effect is noted -Re (or used to be noted -M for mesomerism effect). Conversely, the lone pair of electrons on oxygen atom of the hydroxyl (-OH) and methoxyl (-OCH3) groups, can give electrons to the electronic ring, resulting in rather stable structure because of the resonance effect. Consequently, their electronic effect by resonance results in a tendency to donate electrons from the aromatic ring. In this case, the electronic effect is noted +Re (or used to be noted +M for mesomerism effect). Figure 17.2: Electron withdrawing by resonance effect on benzoic acid and nitro-benzene. It is the original conjugated double bond C=O and N=O that allow for resonance stabilization If you observe carefully now, you will notice that the hydroxyl group has conflicting withdrawing inductive effect (-I) and donating resonance effect (+Re)… So which one wins? Well, outside of halogens (Cl, F, I), and that is the case for us, the resonance effect tends to overwrite the inductive effect or \\(Re &gt; I\\). In fact, for most of functional groups of concern in ecological engineering, i.e., the hydroxyl (-OH), the methoxyl (-OCH3), or the amino (-NH2) groups: \\[+Re &gt;&gt;-I\\] For the groups with -Re effect, the inductive effects are -I, so the inductive and resonance effects act in concert. The consequences are that for most phenolics, aliphatic chains substituted on the aromatic rings that have a π bond with an electronegative atom like oxygen (and possibly with additional conjugated unsaturated bond), tend to be Electron Withdrawing Groups (EWG). These would include the propanoids of the phenylpropanoids, the carboxyl (-COOH) and carbonyl (-CO-), and aldehyde (-CHO) groups. Reversely, groups that have lone pairs available like hydroxyl (-OH) and methoxyl (-OCH3) groups on the oxygen atoms, tend to be Electron Donating Groups (EDG). One interesting consequence is that the pKA of acetic acid (ethanoic acid) is 4.76, while that of benzoic acid is 4.20. This can be interpreted as the result of the carboxyl acting as an EWG on both the benzoic and ethanoic acid, which tends to attract electrons on that group. However, the EWG effect is stabilized by the resonance of the aromatic ring, making the carboxylate (-COO-), i.e., the base conjugate of the carboxyl group, more stable in benzoic acid than in ethanoic acid. One could argue that resonance stabilization should provide a lot more stability resulting in more than just 0.56 pH unit difference. Do not forget, however, that a carboxylate group then acts as a EDG to an aromatic ring, and thus limits the ability of a carboxyl group to easily lose a proton H+. The addition of three hydroxyl groups on benzoic acid to form gallic acid, supposedly three EDG, increase the pKA1 of gallic acid to 4.4, compared to 4.2 for benzoic acid, hence slightly destabilizing the caboxylate group compared to benzoic acid. Overall, because of the general pattern of conjugated double bonds in phenolics, (often unsaturated) aliphatic chains substituted to the aromatic rings that have a double bond with an oxygen atom tend to act as EWG, while the hydroxyl and methoxyl groups ever so present and generating the large divesity of monomeric phenols, essentially act as EDG as a compensation. 17.5.2 Eutrophication Definitions: ‘an increase in the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem’ (Nixon 1995) ‘is the enrichment of a water body with nutrients, usually with an excess amount of nutrients’ (Wikipedia) ‘the enrichment of water by nutrients, especially nitrogen and/or phosphorus, causing an accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms present in the water and to the quality of water concerned’ (Anonymous 1991b) ‘the enrichment of water by nitrogen compounds causing an accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms present in the water and to the quality of water concerned’ (Anonymous 1991a) back to top 17.6 F 17.6.1 Fischer projection see Structural formula back to top 17.7 G 17.7.1 Greenhouse gases (GHG) A greenhouse gas is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth’s surface would be about −18 °C (0 °F), rather than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F). In the Solar System, the atmospheres of Venus, Mars and Titan also contain gases that cause a greenhouse effect.

Production: Hydrogen sulfide often results from the microbial breakdown, or mineralization, of organic matter in anaerobic conditions, such as may exist in swamps and sewers.

In other words, for the pH of most natural waters (4.5 &lt; pH &lt; 8), \\(HNO_3\\) is totally insignificant. Production: from the complete oxidation of inorganic nitrogenous molecules which include ammonia, ammonium, nitrite from the mineralization and complete oxidation of amine radicals in organic molecules Consumption: Uptake from microbes, plants, and algae for their anabolism, which consists in building complex organic molecules from inorganic ones. Uptake, assimilation, anabolism, immobilization are all synonymous terms to express the fact that the N atom is immobilized, at least temporarily in organic molecules. Because N is assimilated in organic molecules during uptake/anabolism, and because N gains electrons in the process (it is thus reduced), we refer to nitrate uptake as assimilatory nitrate reduction. Denitrification: under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is used by facultative anaerobes as electron acceptor to generate ATP in their respiration chain. The two major end products of denitrification are gases, namely dinitrogen (\\(N_2\\)) and nitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\)), which leave the aqueous environment. As such, nitrate is not assimilated by any bacteria and denitrification is therefore, as opposed to uptake, referred to as **dissimilatory nitrate reduction into dinitrogen (\\(N_2\\)) and nitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\)). Ecological significance: Because of assimilation and denitrification processes, the overall nitrate concentrations in rivers tends to diminish from the catchment headwaters to the receiving bodies such as estuaries and coastal areas. As a result, inorganic nitrogen has naturally been in very short supply in these coastal water bodies, and nitrate and traditionally been the nutrient limiting aquatic productivity there. Very much like with phosphate, algae have adapted to be able to grow in very low concentrations. Anthropogenic activities, and agriculture in particular, have largely increased the loads and concentration of nitrate reaching estuaries, to the point where nitrate is no longer the limiting factor. As a result, excess nitrate is one of the reasons for the global and persistent presence of algal blooms in estuaries and coastal waters. Health hazard: There is a heated debate about the health hazard that nitrate might pose. Some argue that if anything, there might be beneficial effects, while others argue that there are evidence of cancers linked to excess nitrate absorption. Unfortunately, arguments on both sides might not be totally independent of militantism and lobbies. The only consensus everybody seems to agree upon is the Blue Baby syndrome, or methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobinemia is an unusual and potentially fatal condition in which hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin and loses its ability to bind and transport oxygen, hence the cyanosis (blue appearance) usually visible on fingers, toes, and lips. Nitrate reduced to nitrite in the body of humans and animals enters the body stream where it seems to directly oxidize oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin-peroxide complex. Picture of a Blue Baby from syndromespedia.com/blue-baby-syndrome.html Drinking water standards Although there is still a heated debate whether or not nitrate does have have detrimental health effects, the World Health Organization has provided maximum concentration guidelines of 50 mg/L as nitrate (World Health Organization 2011). These guidelines have been enacted in hard laws in the US and in Europe. The 50 mg/L as nitrate equates 11.2 mg \\(NO_3\\)-N/L and in the US, the drinking water standard is 10 mg \\(NO_3\\)-N/L. back to top 17.11.2 Nitrous Oxide Commonly known as laughing gas Nitrous oxide has significant medical uses, especially in surgery and dentistry, for its anesthetic and pain reducing effects.

The term oxidation was first used by Antoine Lavoisier to signify reaction of a substance with oxygen. Much later, it was realized that the substance, upon being oxidized, loses electrons, and the meaning was extended to include other reactions in which electrons are lost. back to top 17.12.3 Oxidation state The oxidation state (OS), or sometimes referred to as the oxidation number, quantifies the number of electrons that an atom has gained (expressed as negative charge value) or lost (expressed as positive charge value) compared to the number of valence electrons it has in its free form. As a result, it can be zero, positive or negative. For metal ions, the OS corresponds to its charge The change in oxidation state is a very powerful tool to understand the redox processes involved in the environement. But OS is less than ideal when comparing the absolute number of electrons one element has for itself For example, the nitrogen atom N, has 5 valence electrons. In the dinitrogen molecule N2, the Lewis dot structure suggests that each atom share 3 electrons with the other but essentially have 5 electrons for themselves as in Figure 17.3 Figure 17.3: Electron allocation on each of the N atom for the dinitrogen molecule N2 As a result, the number of electron on each atom equals the number of valence electrons on the free form of N, hence OS = 0. Now in the nitrous oxide case in Figure 17.4, the nitrogen atom to the left OS = 0, but for the middle Nitrogen atom, OS = -2, as two electrons were stripped by oxygen. Figure 17.4: Electron allocation on each of the N atom for the N2O molecule The problem with the oxidation state indicator is that it is a relative number, and not absolute. The electron allocation indicator that quantifies the number of electrons each atom has for itself is more abolute and thus comparable. For example, the inorganic molecule with one C atom stable in an oxidized environment is CO2, the inorganic molecule with one N atom stable in an oxidized environment is \\(NO_3^-\\), and the inorganic molecule with one S atom stable in an oxidized environment is \\(SO_4^{2-}\\). All three atoms have zero electrons for themselves as oxygen has ‘stolen’ them (Figure 17.5). So they are all potential electron acceptors that can accept up to 8 electrons. In a way they are very similar. Figure 17.5: Electron allocation on each of the C, N, and S atom for the CO2, nitrate and sulfate molecules But if one calculates the oxidation states for each of the C, N, and S atoms, for these three molecules, one would find OSC = -4, OSN = -5, and OSS = -6… We believe this can be very confusing and prefer to use the electron allocation concept as a more absolute indicator. back to top 17.13 P 17.13.1 Phosphate Phosphate is an inorganic chemical and a salt-forming anion of phosphoric acid Formula: \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) Lewis dot structure of phosphate Phosphate is one of the anions of the polyprotic acid (i.e., which can liberate several protons \\(H^{+}\\)) The conjugate bases of phosphate are: All conjugate bases are related through the set acid-base chemical equilibria: \\[\\begin{align} H_3PO_4 &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; H_2PO_4^- + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 2.12}\\\\ H_2PO_4^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; HPO_4^{2-} + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 7.21}\\\\ HPO_4^{2-}&amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; PO_4^{3-} + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 12.67} \\end{align}\\] The preponderant form of phosphate in a solution also depends on the pH following this relationship: The phosphoric acid and phosphates are fully oxidized forms of inorganic molecules with just one atom of P: the Phosphorus atom has zero electrons for itself as shown in Figure 17.6 below: Figure 17.6: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of P, including from left to right Phosphoric acid, dihydrogen Phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, and phosphate , showing that the P atoms have no electrons for themselves Production: Phosphorus in general and phosphate in practice has remained one of the nutrients limiting the most plant productivity on our planet Phosphates are the naturally occurring form of the element phosphorus, found in many phosphate minerals Phosphate minerals are mined to obtain phosphorus for use in agriculture and industry The largest global producer and exporter of phosphates is Morocco. Within North America, the largest deposits lie in the Bone Valley region of central Florida, the Soda Springs region of southeastern Idaho, and the coast of North Carolina (near Aurora). Consumption: Uptake from all primary producer including plants and algae Phosphate can also be immobilized by bacteria In food industry, phosphates help baked goods rise, they act as emulsifiers in processed cheese and canned soup, they add flavor to cola and color to frozen french fries. They also can be added to meat, poultry and seafood to help the protein bind more water, making it juicier after freezing and reheating. Ecological significance: Phosphorus as phosphate naturally is the most limiting factor for primary productivity for land and aquatic plants. Because it tends to bind to particles, phosphates have accumulated with sediment particularly in coastal areas, where phosphate can become available again to algae through sediment diagenetic processes. As a result, phosphate is generally not considered the most limiting factor for algae in estuaries and coastal environment. However, it does tend to be the limiting nutrient in freshwater receiving bodies such as lakes and reservoirs. Excess phosphate in freshwater receiving bodies has been shown to be the nutrient causing some major eutrophication problems throughout the planet back to top 17.14 R 17.14.1 Reactive nitrogen back to top 17.14.2 Redox Redox (short for reduction–oxidation reaction) is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed. Any such reaction involves both a reduction process and a complementary oxidation process, effectively allowing the electron transfer processes. 17.14.3 Redox couple redox couples, commonly noted as ‘Ox/Red’ refer to the two forms that an element might take depending on its oxidation state Ox in ‘Ox/Red’ refers to as the oxidizer or oxidizing agent, as it has the capability to make other elements lose their electrons. Red in ‘Ox/Red’ refers to as the reducer or reducing agent, as it has the capability to give electrons to other elements Common redox couples which matter in environmental and ecological engineering include: CO2/CH2O O2/H2O NO3-/N2 NO3-/NH4+ NO3-/NO2- MnO2/Mn2+ Fe3+/Fe2+ SO42-/H2S CO2/CH4 17.14.4 Redox half-reactions A half reaction is either the oxidation or reduction reaction component of a redox reaction. A half reaction is obtained by considering the change in oxidation states of individual substances involved in the redox reaction (Wikipedia contributors 2018b) Redox half reactions illustrate the transfer of electrons from the oxidized form of an element to a reduced form of an element. Half-reactions are often used as a method of balancing redox reactions To derive half-reactions, the first convention is that the oxidizer is on the left of the equation, and the reducer on the right one must first equilibrate all elements other than O and H then one balances for O, by adding H2O on the appropriate side of the half reaction then one adds the appropriate number of H+ to balance the H Finally one adds the appropriate number of e- to balance the charge. The number of e- must correspond to the change in oxidation state The half-reactions corresponding to the redox couples above are: CO2/CH2O \\[\\begin{equation} CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightleftharpoons CH_2O + H_2O \\end{equation}\\] CH2O here is a generic formula to represent the electron donating capacity of OM. This equation might be misleading as it corresponds to the OM donating 4 electrons in the respiration schemes, but because it is written using the ox/red convention, is the opposite of the intuitive direction. So a more intuitive half-reaction might be, and is effectively what is used to write the full redox reaction: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\end{equation}\\] O2/H2O \\[\\begin{equation} O_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightleftharpoons 4H_2O \\end{equation}\\] - NO~3~^-^/N~2~ \\[\\begin{equation} 2 NO_3^- + 10 e^- + 12 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons N_2 + 6 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] - MnO~2~/Mn^2+^ \\[\\begin{equation} MnO_2 + 4 e^- + 4 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons Mn^{2+} + 2 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] - Fe^3+^/Fe^2+^ \\[\\begin{equation} Fe^{3+} + 1 e^- \\rightleftharpoons Fe^{2+} \\\\ \\end{equation}\\] - SO~4~^2-^/H~2~S \\[\\begin{equation} SO_4^{2-} + 8 e^- + 10 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons H_2S + 4 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] - CO~2~/CH~4~ \\[\\begin{equation} CO_2 + 8 e^- + 8 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons CH_4 + 2 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] a redox reaction always involves two half reactions where the electrons are transfered from the lowest redox potential couple to the highest redox potential couple. For example, the combustion of methane in oxygen involves the two O2/H2O and CO2/CH4 couples. The half-reaction of the highest redox potential couple goes on top, and that of the lowest potential at the bottom, but this time written as red/ox like in the equation below: \\[\\begin{align} 2\\,O_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; 4\\,H_2O\\\\ CH_4 + 2\\,H_2O &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; CO_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^-\\\\ &amp; &amp;\\\\ \\hline\\\\ CH_4 + 2\\,O_2 &amp; \\to &amp; CO_2 + 2\\,H_2O \\end{align}\\] The electrons cancel out, and in this case the protons as well. So the combustion of methane, which is very simple at first glance, really involves a transfer of electrons, which the half-reactions reveal. 17.14.5 Reduction Reduction is the gain of electrons by a molecule, atom, or ion. back to top 17.15 S 17.15.1 Skeletal formula The skeletal formula, also called line-angle formula or shorthand formula, of an organic compound is a type of molecular structural formula that serves as a shorthand representation of a molecule’s bonding and some details of its molecular geometry (Wikipedia contributors 2018g). see Structural formula 17.15.2 Structural formula 17.15.3 Sulfate Sulfate is the inorganic sulfur anion stable in oxidized water Formula: \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) Sulfate 3D shape: Lewis dot structure of nitrate: Number of electron S has for itself following electronegativity rule: zero \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) can only be an electron acceptor \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) is the conjugate base of Hydrogen sulfate \\(HSO_4^{-}\\).

We therefore generally omit to mention \\(HSO_4^{-}\\) as a chemical form that plays any significant role.

However, it might be a good thing to have a refresher on what electron orbitals, valence electrons, and Lewis structures are. This appendix proposes a quick refresher on these concepts. A.1.1 Electron orbitals Atoms are made of a nucleus and electrons. The nucleus itself is made of protons and neutrons. In the simplified periodic table below (Figure A.1), the first three lines of the periodic table are represented and the atomic numbers are given for each atom. The atomic number or proton number of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom. It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons (Wikipedia contributors 2018l). Figure A.1: simplified periodic table that show the s and p orbitals for the first 18 atomic numbers (number of protons = number of electrons in each atom) Orbitals express the two waves and particle natures of electrons. At the bottom of each atom box in Figure A.1, one can see odd symbols like 1s2 2s22p2 for the carbon atom. The ‘s’ and ‘p’ letters represent two different electron orbitals. The numbers 1 and 2 before the letter represent the angular momentum of the orbitals, which is also an indication of the electron energy levels. An electron orbital characterizes the high probability of where an electron might be located around the nucleus. Each orbital can be occupied by a maximum of 2 electrons. The wave nature of electrons tells us that the electrons are stable, for a given energy level, in their orbitals. For the biogeochemical processes of this book, we only deal with the CHONSP atoms, which only have s, p, and d orbitals, not f, g, h, etc. What are these bizarre letters s, p, d, f, g, etc. describing orbitals anyway…? They are derived from the description by early spectroscopists of certain series of alkali metal spectroscopic lines as sharp, principal, diffuse, and fundamental” (Wikipedia contributors 2018l). So now, for the low energy level 1, the orbital s appears to be a sphere. In other words the one or two atoms in this orbital will have a very high probability of being in that sphere. The one electron of hydrogen will thus be somewhere in that orbital. For helium, its two electrons will be in this sphere as well and be extremely stable. With only one electron in its orbital, hydrogen is just not very stable, and it ‘tries’ to bond with other atoms such that they can ‘share’ electrons so that the H 1s orbital is ‘visited’ by 2 electrons, which makes hydrogen ‘happy’ and stable. Now, for lithium and Beryllium, which have 3 and 4 electrons (Figure A.1), respectively, their electrons fill a new s orbital, which also is a s orbital with a spherical shape as well, just bigger as the electrons have more energy. Boron and Carbon have 5 and 6 electrons, and their orbitals are not spheres any more. The theory tells that the high probability for these electrons is to be in a space that looks like two ‘eggs’ opposed to each other (Figure A.2). These are called p orbitals. There can be 3 p orbitals which are located along three x,y,z axes with the exact same level of energy. Figure A.2: Shape of the electron orbitals s, p, d, and f. Obtained from https://chem.libretexts.org/ Electron orbitals that have the same energy levels are called degenerate orbitals. The lower energy orbitals are filled before higher energy orbitals. Hund’s rule states that degenerate orbitals are filled evenly before moving to higher energy orbitals. For p orbitals, which consist of three degenerate orbitals that all have exactly the same energy level, we put a single electron in each orbital first then put a second electron (of opposite spin, we have not mentioned spins yet, and will not here) in each orbital to fill them with a total of six electrons. Figure A.3: Hund’s rule to correctly fill in orbitals for the Carbon and Nitrogen atoms. Up and down arrows represent the electron spins. Electrons have to have opposite spins to be located in the same orbital. This has little impact for our purpose The electrons for Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur in their orbitals are represented in Figure A.4 below. you can see that, N and P, and O and S 2p and 3p orbitals, respectively, follow the same ‘filling’ patterns. Figure A.4: Hund’s rule to correctly fill in orbitals for the Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sufur atoms A.2 Orbitals hybridization This is what the theory tells us. In practice, it seems that the interactions of electrons among orbitals, and with bond atoms, make things a little different and new hybrid orbitals actually form. This is the basis of geometrical configuration of molecules and explains the shape of molecules and angles between atoms in a molecule. Does it really matter in biogeochemical processes? Actually quite a bit. Starting with the shape of the water molecule. But before then, let us explain orbital hybridization using the illustration in Figure A.5. Figure A.5: sp, sp2, and sp3 orbital hybridization and illustration for the carbon atom The electronic signature for carbon is 1s2 2s22p2. The Hund’s rule for filling orbitals suggests (Figure A.4) that one of the p orbital has no electrons. Orbital hybridization consists in moving one of the electron in the 2s orbital to fill this empty p orbital. But since electrons on the s orbital are much less energetic than the p ones, the electrons in the resulting new hybrid orbitals are not going to be as energetic. Three possible hybrid orbitals exist in nature: sp, sp2, and sp3 orbitals. For the example of carbon, there also are three orbital configurations. The lowest energy hybridization is that the 4 electrons on 2s22p2 end up in four orbitals, i.e., two in 2 sp orbitals and two in 2 p orbitals, one electron in each. This is the configuration illustrated at the bottom row, and application of this configuration is the CO2 molecule (Figure A.5). The mid energetic configuration is also four orbitals, but this time with 3 sp2 orbitals and 1 p orbital. This is the configuration illustrated at the middle row with an application being the aldehyde configuration in a molecule. The highest energy hybrid orbital is referred to as sp3, where the original 2s22p2 are hybridized into 4 sp3 orbitals, leading to a tetrahedral configuration of the orbitals, with methane being an illustration. So, the same atom can practically change its orbital configuration. And all of this depends on the molecule in which this atom is involved. This is true for all atoms, and particularly the ones we are concerned about, i.e., C, N, O, P, and S (H orbital does not change!). Since, hybridizations change depending on molecular configurations (and vice versa), it is time to recall the two types of atomic bonds prevailing in molecules of interest to us: the σ and π bonds. A.3 σ and π bonds In chemistry, sigma bonds (σ bonds) are the strongest type of covalent chemical bond. They are formed by head-on overlapping between atomic orbitals. […] A σ-bond is symmetrical with respect to rotation about the bond axis. […] Sigma bonds are the strongest type of covalent bonds due to the direct overlap of orbitals, and the electrons in these bonds are sometimes referred to as sigma electrons. (Wikipedia contributors 2018i) A covalent bond, also called a molecular bond, is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full outer shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration. (Wikipedia contributors 2018k) For the CHONSP atoms, σ bonds can be formed between s, p, and spn orbitals (Figure A.6). Figure A.6: Examples of σ bonds with different types of overlap, from s, p, and spn orbitals. Obtained freely and modified under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license pi bonds (π bonds) are covalent chemical bonds where two lobes of an orbital on one atom overlap two lobes of an orbital on another atom. The Greek letter π in their name refers to p orbitals, since the orbital symmetry of the pi bond is the same as that of the p orbital when seen down the bond axis. One common form of this sort of bonding involves p orbitals themselves. […] Pi bonds are usually weaker than sigma bonds. (Wikipedia contributors 2018h) Typically, a single bond is a sigma bond while a multiple bond is composed of one sigma bond together with pi or other bonds. A double bond has one sigma plus one pi bond, and a triple bond has one sigma plus two pi bonds. Figure A.7: Examples in the ethylene molecule of σ and π bonds. The full overlap of sp2 orbitals between the C and H and C and C atoms leads to σ bonds and the overlap between the p orbitals leads to a π bond shown as an elongated blue lobe that extends both above and below the plane of the molecule.

Important examples of molecules where sp, sp2, and sp3 orbitals exist are presented next. Before this, it should be noted that there does not seem to be full consensus on how orbits necessarily form. The orbital hybridization is a model that explains many other observations but remains just a model. There are other models out there but this is beyond the scope of this summary. Additionally, there often are several possibilities of hybridization, and chemistry books do not necessarily agree on what hybrid orbitals atoms take in molecular arrangement. The steric number gives a nice indication on simple molecules on the hybrid orbital the central atom may take. The steric number (SN) is equal to the summation of the number of atoms bound to the central atom + the number of lone pairs left on the central atom. The lone pair can be determined using the Lewis dot structure, presented later in this chapter. The general rule for the molecules we deal with is as such: if SN = 4, the central atom follows a sp3 hybridization if SN = 3, the central atom follows a sp2 hybridization if SN = 2, the central atom follows a sp hybridization A.4 sp3 hybridization examples A.4.1 Methane Methane (SN=4+0=4) is the quintessential example of the hybridization of the Carbon 2s22p2 orbitals into 4 sp3 orbitals. The overlap of the sp3 orbitals of carbon with the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atoms form σ bonds, and create a symmetrical tetrahedral molecular shape. In aliphatic chains, the -[CH2]- are not straight but have angles between consecutive C-C bonds because of the sp3 orbitals. This is one of the reasons for the skeletal formula in organic chemistry (Figure A.8). Figure A.8: The sp3 hybrid orbitals in CH4, Modified from https://www.slideshare.net/pedagogics/2012-orbital-hybrization-sigma-and-pi-bonds A.4.2 The water molecule In the molecule of water, the oxygen (SN=2+2=4) orbitals are hybrid sp3 and two of them from two σ covalent bonds with hydrogen, leaving two sp3 orbitals as two lone pairs or electrons (Figure A.9). Figure A.9: The sp3 hybrid orbitals in H2O, leaving two lone pairs of electrons in two of the orbitals. Obtained freely under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license These lone electron pairs, opposite to the bonds with the H atoms, thus form an important electronic density, rendering the molecules asymmetric both on a geometric and on a charge basis, with the two lone pairs forming a slight electronegative side of the molecule, and the two hydrogen atoms, forming a slight electron positive side of the molecule (Figure A.10). The water molecule: is thus referred to as a polar molecule, i.e., it “has a net dipole as a result of the opposing charges (i.e. having partial positive and partial negative charges) from polar bonds arranged asymmetrically” (Wikipedia contributors 2018n) as a result, water is a good polar solvent that dissolves salts and hydrophilic organic molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, mono-, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. “Because of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules. These bonds are the cause of water’s high surface tension and capillary forces” (Wikipedia contributors 2018r). It is thanks to these capillary forces that, among other things, soils can store very significant amount of water which plants can use for their growth even during drought times. “The hydrogen bonds are also the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of other analogous compounds like hydrogen sulfide (H2S). They also explain its exceptionally high specific heat capacity (about 4.2 J/g/K), heat of fusion (about 333 J/g), heat of vaporization (2257 J/g), and thermal conductivity (between 0.561 and 0.679 W/m/K). These properties make water more effective at moderating Earth’s climate, by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere.” (Wikipedia contributors 2018r) Figure A.10: Illustration of the electric dipole of the water molecule due slight electronegativities and positivies on the O and H atoms, respectively; Hydrogen bonds are one the consequence the polar nature of water.

A.4.3 Ammonia and Ammonium Similar to water, the electron orbitals for the Nitrogen atom in NH3 (SN=3+1=4) and NH4+ (SN=4+0=4) are hybridized into sp3 orbitals. As a result the ammonia molecule has a pyramidal shape (Figure A.11), leaving a lone pair of electrons in the sp3 orbital opposite to the plan made by the H atoms. This lone pair makes ammonia a base, that is a proton acceptor to form ammonium. Similarly to water, and because of the lone pair or electron, ammonia is a polar molecule and thus has the ability to make hydrogen bonds and is thus highly miscible in water. Ammonium, the protonated form of ammonia, uses the lone pair of electrons of ammonia to create a new bond with a proton to eventually form a positively charged tetrahedral molecule, where all N-H bonds are equivalent, and polar covalent bonds. More details on the protonation of ammonia into ammonium and the equilibria is provided in the glossary. Figure A.11: Orbital configuration for ammonia, NH3. Each N–H σ-bonding orbital, containing 2 electrons, is formed from a N sp3 hybrid orbital and a H 1s orbital. The remaining lone pair of electrons occupies the fourth tetrahedral position producing a pyramidal structure.

This makes for a total of 10 shared electrons for sulfur…?! This is possible because sulfur belongs to the third period and has d orbitals open (Figure A.12). The steric number for sulfur in the sulfate molecule (SO42-) is thus SN=4+0=4, suggesting a sp3 orbital hybridization and a tetrahedral geometrical configuration. As a result the sulfate molecule has a pyramidal shape (Figure A.12). Two of the electrons on the filled orbitals 3s and 3p move into 2 of the d orbitals. The π bonds form between the d orbitals and one p orbital of the uncharged oxygen atoms. The σ bonds from from the 4 sp3 orbitals and one p orbital of the negatively charged oxygen atoms (Figure A.12). Figure A.12: Orbital configuration for ammonia, SO42-. Each S–O σ-bonding orbital, containing 2 electrons, is formed from a S sp3 hybrid orbital and a O 2p orbital. The two π bonds are formed from the 3d orbitals and the 2p orbitals of the uncharged oxygen atoms A.4.5 Phosphate Phosphate (PO43-, SN=4+0=4) is probably one of the most fascinating molecule in the living world. Because phosphorus is in the third period of the periodic table, just as sulfur is (Figure A.1), it does not have to follow the octet rules and can accept extra electrons in the d orbitals. Theoretically, the phosphorus orbitals can be hybridized such that the 3s orbital filled with two electrons, and the 3d orbitals filled with one electron each hybridize into 5 sp3 orbitals in the molecule of phosphate. However, in the phosphate molecule, this does not happen. Instead, the hybridization generates 4 sp3 orbitals and one 3d orbitals (Figure A.4). As a result, the phosphate molecule has a tetrahedral steric configuration. Three of the Oxygen atoms gain electrons to become negative and they theoretically do not need to hybridize to from σ bonds using their p orbitals with the sp3 orbitals of the phosphorus. The π bond forms with the 3d orbital left of the phosphorus and the second open 2p orbital of the uncharged O atom. The ‘3-’ charge of the deprotonated phosphate is actually spread evenly on the four oxygen, and each phosphorus-oxygen bond can be considered have some double bond character (Figure A.13). It is the plethora of electrons on the phosphate molecule that is the basis of the storage and release of energy in the ATP molecule. Figure A.13: Orbital hybridization of Phosphorus for the phosphate molecule, and below the even spread of the π bond. Obtained with permission from https://chem.libretexts.org/ A.5 sp2 hybridization examples A.5.1 Nitrate In the nitrate molecule, the nitrogen atom (SN=3+0=3) loses an electron and becomes N+ and reconfigures its orbitals to have three sp2 and one 2p orbitals, each filled with one electron only. The nitrate molecule is thus a planar molecule. Two of the oxygen atoms gain an electron and effectively become O-. It is unclear at this point whether or not the oxygen atoms themselves reconfigure their orbitals or not… There seems to be conflicting descriptions. Most text books tend to agree that the π bond is not particularly located on one oxygen atom, but rather that each of the σ bond has an additional π like bond. The model proposed in Figure A.14 works, although the resonance among all oxygen atoms is not that straight forward in my opinion. Each of the sp2 orbital of N makes a covalent σ bond with one of the 2p orbitals of each of the oxygen. The two 2p orbitals left on both of N and O atoms form a π bond. Similar to Phosphate, the electrons of the π bond spread evenly on the three oxygen, and each nitrogen-oxygen bond can be considered to have some double bond character π bond (Figure A.14). Figure A.14: Orbital hybridization of nitrogen for the nitrate molecule, and the even spread of the π bond A.5.2 Nitrite In the nitrite molecule, the nitrogen atom (SN=2+1=3) does not need to lose an electron and reconfigures its orbitals to have three sp2 and one 2p orbitals, with one sp2 orbital filled with 2 electrons and all other orbitals filled with one electron only. One of the oxygen atoms gains an electron and effectively become O-. The model proposed in Figure A.15 works. Two of the sp2 orbital of N makes a covalent σ bond with one of the 2p orbitals of each of the oxygen. The two 2p orbitals left on both of N and O atoms form a π bond. Similar to nitrate, the electrons of the π bond spread evenly on the two oxygen, and each nitrogen-oxygen bond can be considered have some double bond character π bond (Figure A.15). Figure A.15: Orbital hybridization of nitrogen for the nitrite molecule, and the even spread of the π bond A.6 sp hybridization examples A.6.1 Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the quintessential molecule to illustrate sp hybridization. Carbon dioxide has two double bonds with oxygen, making its steric number to be SN=2+0=2. This suggests that the Carbon orbitals rearrange into 2 sp orbitals. In carbon dioxide, the oxygen atoms also rearrange into sp2 hybrids (Figure A.16), such that the two sp orbitals of the carbon form a σ bond with one of sp2 orbitals available of the oxygen atoms. Then the 2p orbitals left form π bonds together. Because of the configuration of the 2sp2p orbitals, the double bonds are at 90° of each other (Figure A.16). Figure A.16: sp orbital hybridization of carbon for the carbon dioxide molecule, and sp2 orbital hybridization of the oxygen atoms A.6.2 Dinitrogen Dinitrogen (N2) steric number is SN=1+1=2. This suggests that the Nitrogen orbitals rearrange into 2 sp orbitals. The two sp orbitals of the nitrogen form a σ bond together. Two π bonds form as the electrons in the 2p orbitals are shared among the two atoms. This is the reason for the formation of the triple bond in dinitrogen (Figure A.17). This bond is so strong that although there are two lone pairs left on each of the nitrogen atoms, which would make dinitrogen suceptible to lose these electrons, the dinitrogen molecule is mostly inert and unreactive for most metabolic pathways. This is why dinitrogen is referred to as unreactive nitrogen. The triple bond can be broken physically by lightnings, or biologically in very specialized cells such as heterocysts of cyanobacteria, or by symbiotic bacteria living in legumes or (Alnus sp.) root nodules. Figure A.17: sp orbital hybridization of nitrogen for the dinitrogen molecule and formation of the triple bond with two lone pairs left per N atom. The σ bond is formed by direct overlap of the sp orbitals and the the two π bonds by sideways overlap among the 2p orbitals (px and py) A.7 Example of no hybridization A.7.1 Dihydrogen sulfide Interestingly, dihydrogen sulfide (H2S) orbitals do not seem to follow the normal hybridization scheme described above. The steric number for the sulfur is SN=2+2=4, so it would expected that sulfur orbitals would hybridize into sp3 forms. This would then suggest that the angle between the H-S bonds would be around 109° as is the case for the very similar H2O molecule. But measurements suggest that the angle is more like 92°, closer to the 90° angle between the p orbitals (Figure A.18). Figure A.18: Direct overlap of 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms with the 3p orbitals (e.g., py and pz) of the S atom, for a final 92° angle between the H-S σ bonds. Modified from https://www.periodni.com/gallery/formation_of_h2s.png A.8 Lewis dot structures A.8.1 Valence electrons and octet rule Lewis dot structures are representation of the bonds between atoms in molecules and of the lone pairs of electrons that might be left on a particular atom. It is a very powerful tool for us as it allows to allocate the electrons in a molecule (see this Chapter). Several rules have been established to draw Lewis dot structures, which we recall here. Several terms need to be recalled here first. Valence electrons: valence electrons are the electrons that are present in the outer electronic shell of a particular atom. For C, N, and O, valence electrons are the electrons in the 2s2p shell. For S, and P, valence electrons are the electrons in the 3s3p3d outer shell. And for H, the valence electron is the one in the 1s shell. An atom with a closed shell of valence electrons (corresponding to an electron configuration s2p6) tends to be chemically inert. Atoms with one or two more valence electrons than are needed for a “closed” shell are highly reactive due to the following reasons: It requires relatively low energy to remove the extra valence electrons to form a positive ion. Because of their tendency either to gain the missing valence electrons (thereby forming a negative ion), or to share valence electrons (thereby forming a covalent bond) (Wikipedia contributors 2018q). The tendency to gain missing valence electrons to form a closed shell for the CHONSP (8 electrons for CONSP, 2 electrons for H) is called the octet rule, because each bonded atom has eight valence electrons including shared electrons. In their natural state, Hydrogen (H) has 1 valence electron is and is said to be univalent. Carbon (C) has 4 valence electrons, and as a result will tend to have 4 bonds with other atoms in a molecule. There are exceptions such as in carbon monoxide. Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) have 5 valence electrons. N will tend to form three bonds with other atoms in most cases, although it can lose an electron to form 4 bonds like in NH4+, or in N2O, and technically becomes positive. For the vast majority of our cases, P is in the form of phosphate in which P forms four σ bonds and one π bond thanks to the 3d orbital available (see phosphate). Oxygen (O) and sulfur (S) have 6 valence electrons. They will tend to form two bonds in most cases, although they can also gain one electron, become negative, and only have one single bond and a third lone pair of electrons. In the case of the sulfide ion S2-, sulfur gains two electrons and does not bond with any other atom. A.8.2 Building Lewis dot structures Several guidelines are available on chemistry books and tutorials. The one that makes the most sense to me is the technique that consists in drawing each atom with all its valence electrons, and try to build the molecule from this information. Let us take the example of nitrate. Draw all atoms with their valence electrons around them, and put the most electronegative electrons on the outside of the future molecule Draw bonds between two valence electrons for the center and outer atoms. Now, the Nitrogen atom has a lone pair of electrons and three single bonds. As it shares the electrons with oxygen, its outer shell now has eight electrons, so the octet rule is fulfilled. However, each of the oxygen only has 7 electrons so the octet rule is not fulfilled. Since there is a lone pair of electrons on the N, it is possible to share one electron of this lone pair with another electron on one of the oxygen to create a double bond. The octet rule is now fulfilled for the oxygen on the right of the diagram below. It would be tempting to do the same with the left over electron on the Nitrogen to create another double bond with another oxygen. But then, the nitrogen would have five bonds, or the equivalent of 10 shared electrons, and that would go against the octet rule. So this is not a possibility. But now, the octet rule for the Nitrogen is not fulfilled any longer, as it effectively shares 9 electrons… Because oxygen is a lot more electronegative, and nitrogen has this one extra electron left, it can ‘steal’ this electron from the nitrogen, which effectively becomes positive, but regains its octet rule, while the oxygen on the left becomes negative, and has its octet rule fulfilled. The last oxygen now still has 7 electrons total. It needs another one from somewhere. The current molecule is neutral as it N is positive and one O is negative. An extra electron has to come from elsewhere to fulfill the octet rule of the third oxygen, making this oxygen negative as well, and the whole molecule minus one negative. Well, if it is so easy to get an electron ‘from elsewhere’, why not applying this to each oxygen, to begin with like in the diagram below. This would make a NO33- which has all its octet rules fulfilled. To decide we need to introduce the important concept of formal charge. The formal charge (FC) of each atom can be calculated as: FC = (nb of valence electron) - (nb of bonds) - (nb of electrons on lone pairs) In fact, a Lewis dot structure is not complete until the formal charges on each of the atoms are added next to each of the atom. In the end, the most stable/likely molecule is the molecule for which: The formal charge will be as low as possible on each of the atoms, AND, keep the total charge of the molecule as low as possible, AND, have the most electronegative atom have the most negative formal charge. In the previous NO3- vs. NO33-, one cannot conclude among the two molecules just on the formal charges and the electronegativity criteria. However, the molecules being otherwise equal, the lower overall molecular charge of NO3- makes this form possible over the NO33- form. In the sulfate example below, three forms are possible. The octet rule for S is fulfilled for the form on the left, but because sulfur is on the third period, some electrons can be on the 3d orbitals, hence the possibility for more than 8 shared electrons like on the middle and right forms. The formal charges are higher in absolute value for the left form compared to the two others, which makes them preferable. The formal charges on the right form are equivalent to the ones on the middle form. However, in the right form, the formal charge on the lesser electronegative sulfur is lower than those on the oxygens, rendering this form unlikely as well. The probable, preferred form is thus the middle form with two single bonds, two double bonds and two oxygen atoms with a minus one negative charge. This concludes this quick reminder on minimum knowledge applicable to electron orbitals, molecular configurations, and Lewis dot structure. There are many guides and tutorials available on the web and elsewhere to complete this guide, which should be sought to confirm and verify your understanding. Below are some exercises for training purposes. A.9 Molecular orbitals Well, after all this lengthy development, it turns out that about 10% of the observations on molecule properties cannot be explained using the simple atomic orbital (AO) theories and orbital hybridization, collectively referred to as valence-bond theory or as the atomic orbital method (Mulliken 1966)… Remember, that all of these are just theories that are trying to best approximate where the electrons are in space and in time around the nuclei… So Mulliken and Hund (Mulliken 1966) came up with another theory: the Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory, or the Hund-Mulliken theory, which is based on quantum physics and thanks to which electron energies can be calculated more precisely. Now, this is not nearly as simple as the previous theories, unfortunately. The new idea here is to incorporate not only the interactions between the electrons and the nucleus of one atom, but in a molecule, the electrons to electrons interactions, as well as the electrons to several nuclei intereactions. The valence-bond theory and the MO theory, are in fact approximate solutions to Schrödinger’s equation. In essence, they do not exclude each other but are complementary to explain some of the facets of electron localization in molecules. So why introducing this here? It is because MO is the theory that can explain (among many other things) some of the behavior of O2 on our planet: why afterall, does not O2 readily steal all the electrons stored on any atom it is in contact? This boils down to this question: why does organic matter manage to exist at all in an aerobic environment? The electron kleptomaniac attitude of O2 should lead to the automatic oxidation of any other atom. But this does not happen. And the MO theory helps decipher why not! A.9.1 Binding and antibinding regions So first, let us remind ourselves that atoms will bind together if they have any advantage to do so. We have seen that one big incentive is to fulfill the octet rule. Another incentive is when the electron energies are lower when the atoms are in a molecule compared to when they are single atoms. In the H2 example in Figure A.19, the nuclei will naturally distance themselves when the electrons have the lowest energy, i.e., in this case at r0 = 0.074 nm, also called the bond length. The H2 molecule is 458 kJ.mol-1 more stable than the two isolated H atoms, i.e. the bond strength of the H2 molecule is 458 kJ.mol-1 or that it would take 458 kJ.mol-1 to break this covalent bond. Figure A.19: Binding and anti-binding regions where electrons might be located as two atoms get closer together to form a molecule obtained from Chemical bonding occurs when the net attractive forces between an electron and two nuclei exceeds the electrostatic repulsion between the two nuclei. For this to happen, the electron must be in a region of space which we call the binding region. Conversely, if the electron is off to one side, in an anti-binding region, it actually adds to the repulsion between the two nuclei and helps push them away (Libretexts 2013). Figure A.20: Binding and anti-binding regions where electrons might be located as two atoms get closer together to form a molecule (Libretexts 2013) A.9.2 Bonding and antibonding orbitals The big addition of the MO theory is the taking into account of the wave nature of electrons. Remember that an orbital is a space (properly in mathematical terms the square of the wave function) around the nucleus where the electrons are located 90% of the time. Now, the MO theory consists in describing the standing wave in which the electrons are located around the nuclei of the molecule atoms viewed as a whole. One way to look at this is to look at the space where the electrons are expected to be, and that can be viewed as a Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO). In other words, taking H2 as an example, the final MO of the H2 molecule will be a linear combination of the two wave functions or 1s AO of the two atoms. The problem is that one can see that the equation (1s orbitalH + 1s orbitalH) = 1 Molecular orbitalH2 just cannot be as even in quantum mechanics, 1+1=1 does not happen…! So, the LCAO theory thus proposes that the overall MO of the H2, to continue on this example, is a Linear Combination of the wave functions (i.e., the AO of each atom), often written as Ψ. The molecular wave function or the Molecular Orbital of hydrogen atoms A and B for example, can be written as \\[ \\Psi_{(\\sigma)} = N \\times \\left( a \\Psi_{(1s)}(A) + b\\Psi_{(1s)}(B) \\right) \\] with N being a coefficient factor, and a and b being linear coefficients (equal to 1 in the case of homonuclear molecule) and \\(\\Psi_{(1s)}(A)\\) and \\(\\Psi_{(1s)}(B)\\) representing the atomic orbital or wave functions of the atoms A and B. This would apply when the wave functions would be in-phase, in which case there would be constructive interference between the wave functions of the AO. But of course, there is another possible linear combination when the electron wave functions are out-of-phase, in which case there would be a destructive interference between the wave functions \\[ \\Psi_{(\\sigma^{*})} = N \\times \\left( a\\Psi_{(1s)}(A) - b\\Psi_{(1s)}(B) \\right) \\] Figure A.21 illustrates the wave functions (real and imaginary part in blue and red, respectively) of two hydrogen atoms (left and right), and how they may combine for constructive interference creating bonding orbital (center bottom) and for destructive interference creating antibonding orbitals (center top). Figure A.21: Electron wavefunctions for the 1s orbital of a lone hydrogen atom (left and right) and the corresponding bonding (bottom) and antibonding (top) molecular orbitals of the H2 molecule. The real part of the wavefunction is the blue curve, and the imaginary part is the red curve. The red dots mark the locations of the nuclei. The electron wavefunction oscillates according to the Schrödinger wave equation, and orbitals are its standing waves. The standing wave frequency is proportional to the orbital’s kinetic energy. (This plot is a one-dimensional slice through the three-dimensional system.) Caption and figure from (Wikipedia contributors 2020d) A.9.3 Molecular orbital diagrams A.9.3.1 Molecular orbitals for first period elements Graphically, bonding molecular orbital of H2 might be represented as the elongated ballon at the center bottom of Figure A.22, while the antibonding orbital would be represented by the two smaller balloons at the center top. This figure also represents the two 1s atomic orbitals (AO) of each of the hydrogen atoms on each side and the MO diagram of H2 in the center, with the bonding and antibonding orbitals, respectively at a lower and higher energy levels than the AO. Note that the bonding MO is referred to as \\(\\sigma_{1s}\\) while the antibonding MO is referred to as \\(\\sigma^*_{1s}\\). Figure A.22: Molecular Orbital Energy-Level Diagram for H2. The two available electrons (one from each H atom) in this diagram fill the bonding σ1s molecular orbital. Because the energy of the σ1s molecular orbital is lower than that of the two H 1s atomic orbitals, the H2 molecule is more stable (at a lower energy) than the two isolated H atoms. Caption from (Libretexts2020-le?) and diagram from Sparknotes The MO are filled like any orbital, starting from the lower energy levels to the higher ones. Each atom of hydrogen has one 1s electron to share, and thus fill the bonding orbital. Because the electrons in the bonding orbital are at a lower energy level than the two isolated H atoms, the H2 molecule is more stable. The bonding orbitals are stabilizing while the antibonding orbitals are destabilizing the molecule. From such a MO diagram, it is possible to calculate the bond order, which is an indicator of how stable the molecule might be, and the number of bonds it might have. The bond order is calculated as \\[ bond \\space order = \\frac{(nb \\space of \\space electrons \\space in \\space bonding \\space orbitals) - (nb \\space of \\space electrons \\space in \\space antibonding \\space orbitals)}{2} \\] So the bond order for H2 is \\(BO = \\frac{2 - 0}{2} = 1\\) or 1, which is the number of covalent bonds in H2. Now if we summarize this approach to H2, He2+, an He2 (Figure A.23), one can see that the bond order for He2 is zero, and the bond energy is very close to 0 kJ.mol-1. This is because there are two electrons in the antibonding orbital, hence destabilizing the molecule. This He2 is thus unlikely to exist and in fact there is no evidence that it does exist. However, the ionic version He2+ has a bond order of 0.5 and a bond enerby of 301 kJ.mol-1, and has chances to be relatively stable. And indeed, this form seems to exist in nature. Figure A.23: Molecular Orbital Diagram, bond order and bond energy for H2, He2+, and He2. Because the band order for He2 is zero, this molecule is unstable and does not exist, while the other two do Now, this is just for the 1s orbitals. The same would hold true for 2s orbitals. However, for atoms with 2p orbitals things are a little more complicated. Indeed, p atomic orbitals are separated into px, py, and pz orbitals (Figure A.24) following the three 3D axes. When two atoms with p orbitals from the second period get close together, their p orbitals may interact together. It turns out that by convention, it is thought that the pz atomic orbitals are the ones that interact along the nuclei axes to form σ2p and σ*2p, respectively the bonding and antibonding σ molecular orbitals. The px and py atomic orbitals are perpendicular to the nuclei axis and combine to form two π2p and π*2p molecular orbitals (Figure A.24). Figure A.24: 2p atomic orbitals (left) and 2p molecular orbitals as atomic orbitals combine (right). Notice that the combination of 2p orbitals generate three bonding and three antibonding molecular orbitals. The 2pz orbitals combine to form a σ2p and σ*2p orbitals, while the 2px and the 2py combine to form two π2p and π*2p molecular orbitals A.9.3.2 Molecular orbitals for second period elements The next natural step is to explore how the electrons populate these orbitals in the case of homonuclear diatomic molecules from atoms in the second period. This is particularly interesting to ecological engineering matters as atoms such C, N, and O are in this period. First, chemists have numerically shown that the energy levels of the σ2p and the π2p orbitals interchange from B2, C2, and N2 to those of O2, F2, and Ne2 (Figure A.25). Figure A.25: Molecular orbital diagrams for homonuclear diatomic molecules for the second period. The bonding σ2p and π2p orbitals level of energy are a little different from B2, C2, and N2 to those of O2, F2, and Ne2 To fill the newly formed molecular orbitals with electrons, three general rules apply (Wikipedia contributors 2020b): The Aufbau principle states that orbitals are filled starting with the lowest energy The Pauli exclusion principle states that the maximum number of electrons occupying an orbital is two, with opposite spins Hund’s rule states that when there are several MO’s with equal energy, the electrons occupy the MO’s one at a time before two electrons occupy the same MO. Figure A.26: Molecular orbital diagrams for homonuclear diatomic molecules for C2, N2, and O2, as well as the bond order and the bond energy First thing, the diatomic molecule C2 does exist but only in the gas phase as it is extremely reactive since its octet rule is not fulfilled (Figure A.26). For these molecules, the bond order equation applies, but only for the valence electrons of the atoms, in other words, only for the 2p orbitals. As such, the bond order for N2 and for O2 add up to 3 and 2, respectively, corresponding to the triple and double bonds. The bond energy for N2 is very high at 941 kL.mol-1 because all the electrons are in bonding MOs. Because two electrons are in the antibonding orbitals for O2, the bond energy of dioxygen is almost half of that of N2 and about 20% lower than that of C2. Hund’s rule states that the two upaired electrons in O2 should occupy each of the π*2p orbitals. A.9.3.3 Molecular orbitals of O2 reveal unique behavior of respiration The main reason for this summary of what molecular orbitals are to better understand why all atoms storing electrons like in organic matter do not readily lose their electrons to oxygen atoms, especially in an aerobic environment where there are a lot of oxygen atoms in the form of O2. The best chemical definition of O2 I could find is: Ground-state triplet molecular oxygen is a paramagnetic biradical with two electrons occupying separate π* orbitals with parallel spins (Krumova and Cosa 2016) Honestly, this requires a little bit of vocabulary to understand all the subtleties of this great definition…! Ground state: the ground state is defined as the lowest allowed energy state of an atom, molecule, or ion. In other words, the ground state represents the most stable configuration triplet: this refers to having two unpaired electrons (Figure A.27) in the molecular orbital. The word ‘triplet’ comes, in short, from the fact that the Electron spin resonance spectrum of O2 emits photons with three spectral lines, hence triplet. paramagnetic: this means that liquid O2 is weakly attracted by an externally applied magnetic field. This is due to the two unpaired electrons in the molecular orbital that have parallel spins (upward arrows on Figure A.26). Molecules with inverted spins are called diamagnetic biradical (also sometimes called diradical): a radical is an atom that has an unpaired electron. The MO having two unpaired electrons, O2 is thus a biradical (or diradical)3 Figure A.27: Examples of atoms in singlet, doublet, and triplet states. Obtained from Lightex A.9.3.3.1 O2 is a very stable biradical So, what is this all saying? Radicals or monoradicals are known to be particularly reactive, and in fact, most organic chemistry reactions involve radicals. Bi- or diradicals just like monoradicals are also very reactive (Abe 2013). So it is particularly odd that this voracious electron biradical does not want to react with organic matter… But before that, let us make sure that there is no confusion between the Lewis structure of O2 and the molecular orbital of the same molecule. According to the lewis dot structure, the octet rule is fulfilled. But it is the MO theory that is able to decipher the two unpaired electrons in the molecule, which will want to be paired. At least this is the first reason why O2 gets involved in redox reactions in the first place. A first reason for the difficulty for O2 to readily accept electrons and thus be very reactive is explained by Krumova and Cosa (2016): Most nonradical organic molecules are diamagnetic, with pairs of electrons with opposite spins. A spin restriction applies for molecular oxygen to participate in redox reactions with other atoms or molecules as it has to accept, from the reductant, a pair of electrons that have the same spin (i.e. nondiamagnetic) so they can fit into the vacant spaces in the π* orbitals of oxygen. Oxygen is thus unable to efficiently oxidize biomolecules via e.g. addition (2-electron process) (Krumova and Cosa 2016) A second reason why O2 does not readily oxidize everything in its path is that the unpaired electrons seem to be stabilized by resonance among the available orbitals ((Borden et al. 2017); Figure A.28). However, despite the resonance stabilization of the π system of triplet O2, the weakness of the O−O σ bond makes reactions of O2, which eventually lead to cleavage of this bond, very favorable thermodynamically (Borden et al. 2017) To summarize, O2 is considered a bi(di-)radical that can theoretically be very reactive but in the end that is not as much thanks to its resonance stabilization system of the upaired electrons, and when it does accept electrons from an electron donor, it cannot readily accept two of them at once. Rather a series of reactions seems to occur before, as is the case in the oxidative phosphorylation, O2 is reduced into H2O. Figure A.28: Possible distributions, A−D of the two β-spin electrons in the two orthogonal π systems of triplet •OO•. The four α-spin electrons each occupy one of the four 2p-π AOs; so, as shown in resonance structures A−D, it is only the β-spin electrons that are delocalized (drawing and caption from Borden et al. (2017)) A.9.3.3.2 Reduction of O2 to H2O as a multistep reaction involving Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Figure A.29: Molecular orbital diagrams for ground-state molecular oxygen (O2), singlet oxygen (1O2), and ROS (superoxide radical anion O2•2− and peroxide ion O2−2~, deprotonated form of hydrogen peroxide H2O2 (Krumova and Cosa 2016)) O2toH2O-redox-chain-with-ROS Figure A.30: Formation of ROS through energy- and electron-transfer reactions.

This expression H2CO3° in the equilibrium is preferentially used in chemistry because the amount of true carbonic acid in solution is about 1000 smaller than CO2(aq) (see further details in Chapter 11); HCO3-: bicarbonate (the prefix “bi-” is rather misleading and does not correspond to the number of negative charges, which would appear more logical nowadays, and corresponds to an outdated naming system); CO32-: carbonate; CaCO3: calcite mineral; Ca2+: calcium cation.
