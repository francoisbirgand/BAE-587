I suppose we are never done with a subject which is rather amorphous, as it involves many disciplines, and has many fields of application. Wikipedia (2018m) has some nice definitions of Biogeochemistry, including: Biogeochemistry is the study of the cycles of chemical elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, and their interactions with and incorporation into living things transported through earth scale biological systems in space through time. With the definition above, the study of ancient earth history or of modern acid rains (e.g., Degens 1989; Schlesinger 2005) are included in biogeochemistry… The unifying theme is that regardless of the application, the processes involved stay pretty much the same and involve transfer of electrons and protons. Differences within the general umbrella of biogeochemistry comes from the fields of application. The field of application of this book is excess nutrient and sediment loads generated by human activities, their consequences on aquatic ecosystems, and the processes involved to improve and protect groundwater and surface water quality in watersheds. There is a niche in disturbed, nutrient rich, often rural environments, where we perceive there is a need for an integrated and horizontal delivery of knowledge spanning from electron orbitals, biochemistry, cell microbiology, hydrological functioning, process kinetics modeling, and treatment system design. For example, ecological engineers use the natural denitrification process to remove excess nitrate from ground and surface waters. For ecological engineers to improve and optimize denitrification in treatment systems they design, they must recognize that the fuel for denitrification is organic matter, which quality matters very much. As such ecological engineers must understand the molecular makeshift of organic matter used by denitrifier microbes, how and where the energy is stored in the organic molecules themselves. Understanding and optimizing denitrification in man-made systems thus requires being able to draw from knowledge pools that are sometimes taught separately, from where the electrons are located on molecules to hydrological processes. It is possible that readers with strong biological background might find the biological facet of this book a bit short and simple. Just as well, non-engineers should not be afraid of ‘engineering’ in the title. The course is designed to provide the biological knowledge engineers might not have obtained in their curricula, and the quantitative knowledge non-engineers might not have been exposed to as well. Regardless, I do hope that environmental scientists, ecologists, and engineers alike, will find the integration of knowledge useful in this book. The physical objects used as foundation for this class include naturally occurring and human-designed pollutant filters, which may reduce excess nutrient concentrations and loads in rural and suburban environments. Systems reviewed include wetlands, riparian buffers and vegetated filter strips, woodchip bioreactors, streams, stormwater ponds and bioretention zones. This book uses excess nitrogen as the core parameter where the principles of biogeochemical processes are illustrated, and may apply to other fields of application. In summary, this book provides the basic necessary biogeochemical knowledge to answer these questions: How do wetlands, streams, riparian zones, woodchip bioreactors, and other ecologically-based treatment systems filter excess nutrient out of the aquatic environment? How can we as a society, or as ecological engineers and environmental scientists, use or design treatment systems to filter out excess nutrients? 1.2 Biogeochemical processes in pollution flows This book is intrinsically related to the concept of pollution, the consequences of pollution, and what can be done about it. Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change (Wikipedia contributors 2018p). Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities, leading to degradation of aquatic ecosystems (Wikipedia contributors 2018j) The goals of environmental and ecological engineers and scientists are to reduce pollution, and in our case improve water quality. The concept of water pollution implies that there is a source of contamination, contaminants, and at the end, adverse consequences on aquatic ecosystems, but also on human health. It is interesting to realize that there is almost an infinite number of ‘pathways’ from a pollution source to its consequences. To place the field of application of the biogeochemical processes described in this book, one can take an example of a pathway from contaminants to consequences to illustrate the knowledge areas this book focuses on. The most spectacular events are usually reported in the press, which has been extremely instrumental in increasing the global awareness at all levels, and in many cases have triggered regulation changes. The most infamous case was when the Cuyahoga River repeatedly catching on fire near Cleveland caught the attention of the Time Magazine in 1969 (Latson 2015), eventually leading to the Clean Water Act in 1972 (Wikipedia contributors 2018o). Newspaper articles relating and explaining the causes and consequences of pollution are remarkable in many ways: they have a way to encapsulate much information, in simple and concise terms. Since most scientists and engineers are pretty good visual learners, a complimentary approach to written articles can be visual objects. Telling the same story in the form of a flow chart translating a two page article in one visual object can be very effective in a class setting. For this, I have created a simple template to derive such ‘pollution flow charts’. A list of symbols illustrating the important steps between the pollution cause(s) to its consequence(s) are proposed in Table 1.1 below. Table 1.1: List of symbols used to construct a pollution flow chart, which can visually describe pollutions from their sources to their consequences Illustrated Symbol shape Symbol shape Description Label shape list of all the Non Point Sources (NPS) and point sources (PS) Rectangle lists all the direct pollutants resulting from the source(s) Diamond vector(s) of the pollutant(s). Often several Rounded rectangle receiving air or water bodies.

In 2017, an article was written by Lisa W. Foderaro about the causes and consequences of dysfunctional septic tanks in Long Island, NY, USA. It takes the reader between 5 to 10 min to read the article. I let the reader do just that here. ‘Dead Rivers, Closed Beaches’: A Water Crisis on Long Island By LISA W. FODERARO MAY 8, 2017 OAKDALE, N.Y. — The Great South Bay, flanked by Fire Island and the South Shore of Long Island, once produced half the shellfish consumed in the United States, and supported 6,000 jobs in the early 1970s. Since then, the health of the bay has declined. Housing development meant more septic tanks depositing more nitrogen in the ground. The nitrogen flowed to rivers and the Great South Bay, leading to algae blooms. It depleted salt marshes that serve as fish habitat and suppressed oxygen levels. One result is that the shellfish industry has all but collapsed. The annual harvest of hard clams, for example, has fallen more than 90 percent since 1980. After sweeping legislation that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed in April, Suffolk County and other local governments in New York are hoping to deal with their aging — or absent — sewer lines, drinking water systems and other water infrastructure. The law, the Clean Water Infrastructure Act, allocates $2.5 billion to a variety of projects, as concerns about the safety of drinking water are growing. Across the United States, impressive gains in water quality were made in the decades after passage of the Clean Water Act of 1972. But courts have generally ruled that the federal law was designed to address surface water contamination, and are divided about its application to tainted groundwater. As a result, problems from industrial pollution and untreated sewage have persisted. The water quality problem is acute in Suffolk County. With 360,000 septic systems, Suffolk has roughly the same number as all of New Jersey. For years, nitrogen from leaky septic tanks has seeped into groundwater and eventually into rivers and bays. “What we have been doing for decades is just managing the decline of water quality,” said Steven Bellone, the Suffolk County executive. “Every water body is listed as impaired. We have dead rivers, closed beaches, harmful algal blooms. Before signing the law on Long Island in late April, Mr. Cuomo noted that a quarter of New York’s 610 sewage treatment plants were operating past their useful life. “We’re living off the legacy not of our parents but of our grandparents,” he said. The new state act, which spans five years, will among other things provide $1.5 billion in grants for water infrastructure improvements, $75 million in rebates to help homeowners replace septic systems and $110 million to protect land in watersheds. The money significantly expands a similar state infrastructure fund that over the last few years made $400 million available to communities. In addition to the new water infrastructure financing, the state budget allotted $40 million to build two sewer systems in business districts on the North Shore in Suffolk County. And there was $5 million for Suffolk County and the Center for Clean Water Technology at Stony Brook University to develop new methods of removing contaminants from drinking water. While it was one of the more significant investments to emerge from the state budget, some say it should be viewed as a down payment. Steve Englebright, a state assemblyman who heads the Environmental Conservation Committee, has said $80 billion to $100 billion is required to address the state’s aging water infrastructure. On Long Island, which is already grappling with hazardous waste at scores of active Superfund sites, the geology poses special challenges. With scant wastewater treatment, Suffolk County sits atop an aquifer that provides virtually all of its drinking water, and the sandy soil allows nitrogen to seep into it. Nassau County, just west of Suffolk, has many more homes using sewers than Suffolk, where 75 percent of the population relies on septic systems. The main reason that a county as populous as Suffolk has remained on septic systems, county officials say, is the legacy of the last attempt at installing a system — the infamous Southwest Sewer District. The sewer system, covering parts of the towns of Islip and Babylon, was eventually built. But the project, which started coming on line in 1981, became so mired in corruption, delays and cost overruns that it spooked future elected officials. “It was the biggest scandal in the county’s history,” Mr. Bellone said. “The appetite politically to do anything on this issue was nonexistent after that. It effectively killed sewering here for decades.” Suffolk County is eager to catch up to Nassau on wastewater treatment, but officials say new sewer systems are prohibitively expensive. One project on the drawing board, for instance, will cover about 8,200 parcels bordering four rivers that feed into the Great South Bay. The price tag is $383 million. Instead, the county’s strategy is to coax homeowners to replace antiquated septic tanks with high-tech “denitrification systems” — small units that cost more than older septic systems but remove most of the nitrogen from wastewater. Mr. Bellone said Suffolk hoped to tap the new state fund to help property owners acquire the systems. The same article can be summarized very efficiently in a pollution flow chart illustrated in Figure 1.1. The causes of this pollution are leaky and dysfunctional septic tanks. The results are that untreated nitrogen finds its way through the groundwater (GW), which is the vector in this article. The article mentions two receiving bodies: the bay and the aquifer. There are potential health risks associated with too much nitrogen added in the aquifer which serves as a drinking water supply (e.g., drinking water limit in the US for nitrate is 10 mg N/L). The article particularly insists on the fact that much of the excess nitrogen finds its way to rivers and end up in the Great South Bay, where algal blooms form. The consequences of the algal blooms are all linked to the depletion of oxygen generated from the large amount of organic matter decaying in the bay. Figure 1.1: Pollution flow chart for the article ‘Dead Rivers, Closed Beaches’: A Water Crisis on Long Island, published in the New York Times, in May 2017 This book aims at providing enough details about the important steps of this and other pollution flow charts. In particular, this book aims at providing the necessary knowledge for environmental scientists and engineers to be able to describe with confidence the processes and the actors at play in a generic pollution chart. As such this book addresses the conditions that lead to algal blooms, and provides enough phycology knowledge to describe the major bloom forming groups. The book particularly insists on the biogeochemical processes associated with eutrophication, which are very close to the ones at play in treatment systems naturally existing or man-designed to reduce pollutant loads closest to their source (Figure 1.2) Figure 1.2: Target areas and processes for this class in the pollution flow chart for the article ‘Dead Rivers, Closed Beaches’: A Water Crisis on Long Island 1.3 Scope of this book The scope of this book is to provide an ‘horizontal’ view across disciplines going from electron orbitals to efficiency of man-made treatment systems in removing pollutants. For this, this book reviews and puts together into one ensemble the necessary knowledge from disciplines including chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, thermochemistry, modeling, and ecological engineering. The book first reviews the electron allocations on atoms and molecules, which are at the source of the generation and storage of energy in the biosphere. The book provides the necessary thermochemistry knowledge by introducing the notions of pH and pε and teaches how to draw pH-pε diagrams. The book presents the functioning of several treatment systems and uses wetlands as a teaching model where most of the biogeochemical processes important in ecological engineering are present. The book details in mathematical terms process kinetics and models often applied in ecological engineering. 1.4 Exercises The goal of the exercises below is to draw pollution flow charts from articles published in the press and to realize that there always are at least a contaminant source, a vector, a receiving body, and environmental and health consequences. Not all elements are necessarily reported in all press articles, but they generally are. Good luck! Florida Red Tide: Wildlife Advocate Stunned by Toll on Fish By The Associated Press Aug. 22, 2018 ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — The head of one of the U.S.’s largest environmental nonprofits says he was stunned Wednesday to see thousands of dead fish and devastation to other marine life from a red tide off hugging southwest Florida’s Gulf Coast. Collin O’Mara, the president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, went on Wednesday with a charter boat captain in waters off Southwest Florida coast in the Sanibel Island area. He reported thousands and thousands of dead fish, eels and horseshoe crabs in the Gulf of Mexico. He also saw the carcasses of six-foot-long Goliath grouper fish. “I was astounded by the level of carnage that we saw,” said O’Mara. “Of all the disasters I’ve seen in the past decade, this is probably the most visual.” The toxic algae bloom has overrun Florida’s southern Gulf Coast this summer. It’s hugging much of Florida’s peninsula, from Naples in the south to Bradenton some 150 miles north. Red tide is a natural occurrence that happens due to the presence of nutrients in salt water and an organism called a dinoflagellate. This bloom started in November. The last toxic bloom in the Gulf happened between 2004-2006. The algae bloom can cause breathing problems in some people, and because of the smell left behind by the dead fish, has cleared vacationers from some tourist areas. But the main impact has been on the wildlife, and experts are concerned. “It was actually pretty overwhelming being there,” said O’Mara, who also toured another part of the state on Wednesday to look at a different algae crisis. He visited areas affected by blue-green algae, which is in freshwater. Heavy May rains caused Lake Okeechobee to discharge water containing blue-green algae into rivers and canals. The bright green sludge oozed onto docks, dams and rivers. People often get the two algae confused, because they’re occurring simultaneously, and in some cases, in the same county. The red tide algae in the Gulf has killed at least 452 sea turtles, nearly 100 manatees, 11 dolphins and tons of fish. County maintenance crews have had to use backhoes to scoop up all the dead marine life on the beaches. Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in seven counties along Florida’s Gulf that have been overrun by the pungent bloom. He also ordered $1.5 million to be spent on various clean-up efforts and to help business impacted by dwindling tourists. By The Editorial Board Oct. 25, 2016 North Carolina’s Noxious Pig Farms The landscape of eastern North Carolina is dotted with giant pools of bright pink sludge. These are waste lagoons, where industrial farms across the state dispose of billions of gallons of untreated pig urine and feces every year. The waste can carry E. coli, salmonella, cryptosporidium and other bacteria that can lead to serious illness or death if they spread to humans. After Hurricane Matthew deluged North Carolina this month, at least 14 of the lagoons flooded. Environmental advocates and state officials have been flying over regions to identify overflowing lagoons where floodwaters have become mixed with the waste, a public health hazard that could last for weeks as bacteria flow into rivers and streams, potentially sickening those who come into contact with those waters. Bacteria can also contaminate groundwater, the main source of drinking water for more than three million North Carolinians. Meanwhile, the nitrogen and phosphorus in hog waste can kill fish and damage ecosystems. State officials are now beginning to test rivers to assess the level of contamination. In states where hog farmers use waste lagoons, like North Carolina and Illinois, flooding is a serious hazard that may become more frequent as climate change leads to more severe storms. Even under normal conditions, lagoons can produce dangerous gases, noxious smells and dust containing hog waste. People living near these lagoons are at increased risk of asthma, diarrhea, eye irritation, depression and other health problems. A research program at North Carolina State University has found several safer waste-disposal methods, including one that converts nitrogen in waste into harmless nitrogen gas and uses another process to eliminate harmful bacteria. North Carolina took steps toward protecting its residents by passing a moratorium on new lagoons in 1997 and making it permanent in 2007. But around 4,000 lagoons constructed before 1997 remain in active use. Unless North Carolina and other states require agriculture companies to change their waste-disposal methods, what happened after Hurricane Matthew will happen again. References "],

We have also seen that these three challenges are inter-connected and related. Nutrients and organic matter are related because the former contain the needed atoms necessary to build living cell and organism structures, corresponding to living organic matter, while the latter generally refers to dead organic matter and/or the assemblage of molecules which at one point were part of a living organism. This definition of the linkage between the two is hardly satisfying, however… When one looks at where the electrons are allocated on the important atoms, a much more unifying scheme appears. This chapter describes this unifying scheme. 2.1 The five fundamental requirements of life Before we dive down to the electron level, let us make sure we recognize that it is possible to simplify why there is, or not, life on our planet and the universe. At least five requirements appear fundamental for life to exist on our plant. Such a list includes: the presence of liquid water available nutrients that can fulfill the need for the six most numerous and important atoms that build most of our cell and organism structure: C, H, O, N, S, P. Without the commas comes this delightful acronym CHONSP which generations of students have come to love a source of energy, which in most cases is in the form of solar or chemical energy electrons acceptor(s), without which chemical energy cannot be released a suitable temperature range (about -5°C to +50°C) because of course most of living organisms will not live for very long outside this range There are many other requirements for life to occur, e.g., the ability to reproduce or even to die, but for what we are interested in, this is a satisfying list. In this chapter, we will address sources of energy and the secret that living organisms have found to store energy. Primary producers, which include most of chlorophyll containing plants from algae to angiosperms (flowering plants), have the ability to use solar radiations as a source of energy. An entire chapter is dedicated to this marvel. However, solar radiation cannot be the sole source of energy for primary producers, otherwise they would die at night… And for the rest of living organisms, solar radiation is just not a source of energy (merely a source of ‘bien-être’ or vitamin D for humans…!). So obviously, life has had to find a solution so that energy would be available for all conditions of light and temperature on earth. The first secret of life is the ability to store energy in the form of high energy electrons stored within organic molecules. Having a source of energy is always a good thing. However, energy can only be released if there is an outlet for it, otherwise it stays as potential energy. Practically, this means that the energy stored on organic molecules can and is only released when the electrons go from the high potential to a lower one, or in others words from electron donors (most of the time from organic molecules) to electron acceptors. This is the second secret of life on earth: on our planet exists this miracle molecule, O2, which acts as an extremely powerful electron acceptor. So you have to imagine O2 less as a gentle acceptor of electrons that organic matter would be kind enough to donate, but more like a very aggressive electron seeker and any organic matter located close to oxygen runs the risk to be oxidized, that is to lose its electrons. Sometimes, I like to refer to O2 as the electron kleptomaniac. So in oxygenated environments such as earth’s atmosphere and most water bodies, living organisms’ only concern is to have potential energy available in the form of high energy electrons stored onto organic molecules, because this energy can easily be released at any time thanks to the very oxidizing agent O2. Chapter 5 goes into the details of how this energy is released and transferred in cells. 2.2 Electron allocation onto CHONSP First, among the 6 atoms that form CHONSP, and this is true for all atoms except for noble gases which are stable monatomic atoms, none of them exist as monatomic atoms: they always form bonds with other atoms to form molecules. Among the CHONSP, three of them are homonuclear diatomic molecules, i.e., they can form molecules of two atoms of the same chemical element: H2 (dihydrogen, although it is most often referred to simply as hydrogen, which can be quite confusing), O2 (dioxygen, although oxygen is also most often used, unfortunately), and N2 (dinitrogen, which name is generally properly applied). Obviously, they can also bind to other elements, which is what we are about to see. If indeed, on our planet floats a very oxidizing agent in the form of O2, then the stable state of all other molecules should be where most of their elements have lost all their electrons to oxygen. And there ought to be techniques to see where the electrons are allocated on molecules. 2.3 Electronegativity as a powerful tool to allocate electrons Chemists have created the oxidation state (OS) or oxidation number indicator which quantifies this electron allocation to some extent, but at this stage, we find it to be rather confusing for our purpose of allocating or view where the electrons are Stored in molecules. More discussion and information on Oxidation State is available in the glossary of this book Oxidation States are used extensively later on. We must first look in the electronegativity concept. Electronegativity is a chemical property which describes how well an atom can attract an electron to itself. In the periodic table in Figure 2.1, first observe that our CHONSP all belong to the non-metallic atoms. Figure 2.1: Vibrant Periodic Table With 118 Elements. Obtained freely from https://sciencenotes.org/periodic-table-pdf-2/ Second, all atoms are more or less electronegative. The most electronegative atom is F, fluorine. Electronegativity decreases towards the left and the bottom of the table as illustrated in Figure 2.2. For our CHONSP, ElecNegO &gt; ElecNegN &gt; ElecNegS &gt; ElecNegC &gt; ElecNegH &gt; ElecNegP. Figure 2.2: Periodic table of the elements with electronegativities shown. Obtained freely from https://sciencenotes.org/list-of-electronegativity-values-of-the-elements/ If you look carefully in Figure 2.2 and in equation (2.1), you will see that the electronegativity of oxygen is 3.44, which is a lot greater than that of N (3.04), and the difference between N and C and S, is about 0.5. In other words, all the CHNSP stand no chance next to O: in any molecule which may involve CHNSP, the O atom will attract the electrons for itself. \\[\\begin{align} O \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; N \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; S \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; C \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; H \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; P \\\\ 3.44 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 3.05 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.58 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.56 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.30 \\quad &amp;&gt;&amp; 2.19 \\tag{2.1} \\end{align}\\] The electronegativity numbers give an estimation of how much the electrons will be pulled towards the more electronegative atom compared to the less electronegative one, sometimes creating some polarization of the molecule. Here we use this concept a little further and allocate all the electrons to the more electronegative atom. This is admitedly artificial and, again, in reality electrons are shared and electronegativity only describes the tendency of an atom to attract a shared pair of electrons towards itself. However, allocating electrons using the electronegativity as a basis is an extremely powerful tool to visualize where electrons are and whether and how much energy is stored on organic matter. For example, in the H2O molecule, one can see in the Lewis dot Structure below that by allocating the electrons based on electronegativity, the O atom has all the electrons for itself, while the 2 H, have none for themselves. Let us make sure that there is no confusion between the octet rule and the electronegativity as applied here. Atoms assemble into molecules so that their octet rules be fulfilled. So in the H2O molecule, yes each H shares an electron with the O and reciprocally. But, allocating the electrons using the electronegativity as detailed above tells us which atom really has the electrons for itself. And that atom is O. Figure 2.3: Electrons allocated to the oxygen atom on the water molecule using electronegativity as a guide for allocation We realize that the electron allocation can be quite confusing or a bit artificial at first, but we shall see in Chapter 7 that it is fully corroborated with oxidation and reduction processes. You can now see in equation (2.1), that sulfur and carbon nearly have the same electronegativity, which is one of the reasons for the ease of formation of the disulfur bridges in proteins. Also notice that phosphorus has the lowest electronegativity of our CHONSP, and this is the reason why, as we shall see later, phosphorus stays in the oxidized form, even in organic molecules. 2.4 Dioxygen: the ‘electron kleptomaniac’ molecule Oxygen is a homonuclear diatomic molecule, which means that it can form the diatomic molecule O2. The two atoms of Oxygen, having the same electronegativity, split the electrons, which means that each atom has 6 electrons for itself as shown in Figure 2.4. So if we summarize things, we have the most electronegative atom in the universe after Fluorine (Figure 2.2) that is floating in most places on earth and in water essentially in a state (O2) where it really would rather have 8 rather than 6 electron for itself! This is the reason why oxygen is the ultimate electron acceptor, although a better representation might be to describe it as the ultimate ‘electron kleptomaniac’. Figure 2.4: Electrons equally allocated to each O atom on the dioxygen molecule But let us be clear: the oxygen atom can only be an electron acceptor if it does not have 8 electrons for itself. The only two possibilities are in the case of O2, for which each atom as 6 electrons for itself, and the other possibility is for hydrogen peroxide \\(H-O-O-H\\), where each oxygen atom have 7 electrons for themselves. Because oxygen is the most electronegative atom (after fluorine), in all other molecules where it is involved, oxygen will have 8 electrons for itself, and can therefore never accept more electrons. This is the first time that this concept is presented in this book, but not the last, and the earlier the reader fully digests this information, the better. Again, and I purposely repeat here, in all other molecules where the oxygen atom is involved, oxygen will have 8 electrons for itself, and can therefore never accept more electrons. As a result, in organic molecules, the electrons allocated to oxygen are never available to be donated and should never be counted as stored electrons. 2.5 Fully Oxidized forms of CNSP On our planet, we are lucky to ‘bathe’ in an oxidized environment, which means among other things, that the oxygen atom will tend to attract all the electrons for itself during interaction with CHNSP. Another way to look at it is to say that the stable state in an aerobic environment of the CHNSP atoms corresponds to molecules where the CHNSP atoms will have zero electrons for themselves (because oxygen stole them). In this case, we say that these atoms are fully oxidized, litterally, that oxygen has stolen all electrons from them. The action of losing electrons is referred to as oxidation by analogy. Reversely, an atom that has 8 electrons for itself is referred to as fully reduced, and the action of gaining electrons is called reduction. Although the terms were initially used to describe reactions with oxygen, losing or gaining electrons does not involve oxygen only, and the words oxidation (losing electrons) and reduction (gaining electrons) apply to any other atoms. Well, and guess what, there are not that many possible molecular configurations for which CNSP are fully oxidized, in fact only one for inorganic molecules with a single C, N, S, or P atom in them! In Figure 2.5 below, you can see that none of the CNSP atoms have electrons for themselves: they have all been taken by the oxygen atoms! Figure 2.5: Electron allocation on each of the C, N, S, and P atoms for the CO2, nitrate, sulfate, and phosphate molecules, showing that C, N, S, and P atoms have no electrons for themselves, or are fully oxidized, while Oxygen has 8, or is fully reduced As a result, these molecules are deemed as stable in an aerobic environment. This suggests that all other molecules containing CNSP are essentially unstable on our planet…?! Yes, you read it correctly, that is the case! Honestly, there is nothing new really as this has been written a long time ago, e.g., in the first book of the Hebrew Bible or the Christian Old Testament “you are dust and to dust you will return” (Gn 3:19). So we essentially have a reprieve on this planet, but so do all living creatures!! The secret of life has been to be able to create and maintain CNSP atoms with electron for themselves, very well ‘knowing’ that these electrons would eventually be stripped away by O2, but living organisms take advantage of this because the transfer of electrons generates energy (see Chapter 5). Notice that the suffix of the oxidized forms of N, S, and P, is -ate. The exception appears to be CO2, which is a gas while the -ate molecules are dissolved ions. However, the ionic forms of dissolved CO2 are bicarbonate and carbonate, which have the suffix -ate. So everything is logical in the end. To be complete, all the fully oxidized forms of CNSP may lose or gain protons (H+) depending on the pH. It turns out that for the pH range encountered in most natural waters (3.5 &lt; pH &lt; 9), only the carbonates and the phosphates may have different molecular formulae. So the fully oxidized forms of C in inorganic molecules are illustrated in Figure 2.6 below (additional details available in the glossary): Figure 2.6: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of C, including from left to right CO2, carbonic acid, hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate), and carbonate, showing that the C atoms have no electrons for themselves The fully oxidized forms of P in inorganic molecules are illustrated in Figure 2.7 below (additional details available in the glossary): Figure 2.7: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of P, including from left to right Phosphoric acid, dihydrogen Phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, and phosphate , showing that the P atoms have no electrons for themselves 2.6 Oxidation versus Reduction But if O2 wants electrons so badly from any atom, how come all living creatures do not just turn into ‘dust’, i.e., carbon dioxide, nitrate, sulfate and phosphate, all the time or manage to live at all?? A minimum ‘energy obstacle’ must be overcome for electrons to be transferred: this is referred to as the activation energy (see Chapter 5). This obstacle is overcome during combustion: the high temperature of a flame self-propagates the transfer of electrons from organic matter to O2. Chapter 5 provides in great detail how living organisms manage to allow enough transfer of electrons to generate energy, without turning into ‘dust’ at once like in combustion. Yet, when an organism dies, all the electrons stored onto the organic molecules are eventually taken by oxygen in an aerobic environment. We have now established that oxygen eventually takes all electrons, but for that to happen, a minimum energy obstacle must be overcome. This opens the possibility for CNSP to, at least temporarily, have electrons for themselves. This also opens the possibility to an infinite number of possible combinations of CHONSP assemblages in nature. Before we get there though, it is time to repeat some important terms. The word oxidation comes from the early days of chemistry referring to reactions where oxygen was involved, and in reality ‘stole’ electrons from other atoms. We now know that oxygen is not necessarily the only one involved in loss of electrons. By extention, any atom which loses electrons, not necessarily to O2, is said to be oxidized. Conversely, an atom which gains electrons is said to be reduced or to undergo reduction. This term also comes from the early days of chemistry when Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794) observed that the weight of a heated metallic ore diminished due to the loss of dioxygen as a gas; and the metallic ore appeared reduced in size and in weight (Wikipedia contributors 2018f). We now know that this corresponds to the acquisition of electrons, hence the word reduction for the gain of electrons. Several mnemonics exist in English to associate electron loss/gain with oxidation/reduction: LEO (Loss of Electrons is Oxidation) the lion says GER (Gain of Electrons is Reduction)! OIL RIG: Oxidation Is Loss (of electrons) Reduction Is Gain (of electrons) When oxygen takes electrons from another atom, we say that oxygen has been reduced, while the other atom has been oxidized. An oxidation is necessarily accompanied with a reduction, as electrons do not ‘float’ in solution like protons do. When the CNSP atoms have lost all their electrons like in Figure 2.5, we say that the CNSP atoms are fully oxidized. Fully reduced atoms have 8 electrons for themselves, as is the case for oxygen in carbon dioxide (and carbonates), nitrate, sulfate, and phosphates. This suggests that between fully oxidized and fully reduced, there might be cases where atoms are partially oxidized and reduced. 2.7 A gradient of oxidation and reduction states on inorganic and organic molecules The number of electrons (1, 2, etc. up to 8) the CNSP atoms have for themselves dictates the atomic makeshift of molecules or molecular radicals. It is now time to define what organic vs. inorganic molecules are. The term organic molecule finds its roots in vitalism, where it was believed that the elements entering in the composition of living organisms had to be different to the ones that made inanimate things. The term organic has remained, and a more modern definition is that an organic molecule is a molecule where there is at least one \\(C-C\\) bond. The best definition of an inorganic molecule is a molecule that is not organic. One of the most important things to understand and learn in this part is that it is the electron allocation which essentially defines what a molecule will be. For example, molecules such as carbon dioxide CO2 and methane CH4 are quite different, one involves oxygen, the other hydrogen atoms. But in reality, one can make sense of the difference by looking at how many electrons the C has for itself. When C has zero electrons for itself, this means that some other electrons have stolen all the electrons from C, and there are not that many possibilities out there. The solution is O=C=O or CO2 and the carbonates (Figure 2.6). For the record, there are at least two other inorganic molecules that exist out there for which C has zero electrons for itself: cyanate (N≡C-O-) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). However, these are present in relatively miniscule quantities. So, for environmental and ecological applications, it is fair to say that the ‘only’ carbon-based inorganic molecules with zero electrons are CO2 and the carbonates. Reversely, the only molecule containing one C atom with 8 electrons for itself is a molecule where all the other atoms bound to the C atom give their electrons away. The only atom that will do this is hydrogen, so the only possible molecule with a C atom is methane CH4. Thus, CO2 is an example of a molecule in which carbon is fully oxidized (lost all its electrons), while CH4 is a molecule in which carbon is fully reduced (gained all possible 8 electrons). In other words, it is quite interesting to look at molecules from the stand point of the number of electrons atoms have for themselves and speculate on the different possibilities of molecules. Obviously, the examples of CO2 and CH4 are simplistic because they are simple, inorganic molecules. Two other simple examples but that of fully oxidized and reduced molecular “pairs” with relevance to matter very much in our field, are nitrate (NO3-) vs. ammonium (NH4+), and sulfate (SO42-) vs. hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Identifying which of the molecules in the pair is more oxidized or reduced is simple. For fully oxidized compounds, the central atom of interest (e.g. S or N) must have no electrons to itself by definition. This electron deficiency must be caused by the presence of an atom more electronegative than the central atom. We might (correctly) guess then, that the fully oxidized form of S or N is attached to the “ultimate electron acceptor” oxygen. So, the fully oxidized versions of S and N are sulfate (SO42-) and nitrate (NO3-) respectively. Conversely, hydrogen-containing NH4+ and H2S are the fully reduced forms of N and S. This is because hydrogen, the least electronegative of CHONSP, “provides” electrons to N or S (Table 2.1). Overall, across organic and inorganic molecules, there is an entire gradient of number of electrons allocated on the C, N, and S (Table 2.1). Notice that I purposely omitted to mention P here, because the only form of P relevant for environmental and ecological engineering are the phosphates. And we have seen that in the phosphate molecules, P always has zero electrons for itself. It is therefore always in an oxidized form (Figure 2.7). Table 2.1 summarizes a gradient of electron allocations, or a gradient of oxidation and reduction states, on the CNSP atoms. It is important to notice several things: Carbon is the only atom with a variable number of electrons in organic molecules N and S always have 8 electrons for themselves in organic molecules This suggests that carbon is quite a variable of adjustment for electron ‘acquisition’ and ‘donation’ This is why the first step of photosynthesis stores electrons on the C atom rather than any other atom Because C can be stripped of its electrons a lot easier than N or S, the latter will just not give their electrons in an environment where C can do that for them first. As a result, and this is crucial for our field, the inorganic byproducts containing C, N, or S of the oxidation of organic matter in respiration (details in Chapter 5) are CO2, where carbon has been fully oxidized, and NH4+ and H2S, where N and S are still fully reduced, as they do not get oxidized during heterotrophic respiration. Notice that N and S only have variable numbers of electrons in inorganic molecules. The N atom of nitrite has two electrons for itself and is highly unstable in aerobic environments as oxygen will try to steal its electrons. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfite (SO32-) also are in very small quantities in the atmosphere (SO2) or in water as HSO3- (not represented in Table 2.1) and SO32-, as both will readily be oxidized in sulfuric acid and sulfate. Notice that N2 has 5 electrons for itself, which is quite a lot and, therefore, potentially is an important electron donor. However, the triple bond N≡N is very difficult to break and O2 does not, even at high temperatures. As a result, N≡N is an inert or unreactive gas, although it makes for about 78% of earth’s atmosphere. Nitrogen in N2 is thus referred to as unreactive nitrogen.

Let us take the example of glucose. Glucose is the result molecule of photosynthesis, where electrons have been stored onto the carbon atoms, which originally contained none as the nutrient from which glucose molecule is assembled is CO2. How can one see this? In the equation (2.2), the half reactions for the production of glucose! Additional details on redox half-reactions are provided in the glossary. What is important to see here is that: 24 electrons are necessary to built glucose from CO2 that these 24 electrons originally come from the oxygen atom of H2O that as oxygen atoms from water lose electrons, they form O2, where each atom has only 6 electrons for itself (Figure 2.4) \\[\\begin{align} 6\\,CO_2 + 24\\,H^+ + 24\\,e^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\\,H_2O\\\\ 12\\,H_2O &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; 6\\,O_2 + 24\\,H^+ + 24\\,e^-\\\\ &amp; &amp;\\\\ \\hline\\\\ 6\\,CO_2 + 6\\,H_2O &amp; \\to &amp; C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6\\,O_2 \\tag{2.2} \\end{align}\\] After what we have said about oxygen and its propensity to steal all electrons, why would it suddenly give electrons to C to form glucose? Indeed, there is some magic involved and it is called photosynthesis! For this to happen, magic catalysts must be able to steal the electrons from oxygen of H2O, and a lot of energy captured in the form of light is necessary! And indeed in the end, thanks to the electron allocation concept, it is possible to visualize where all electrons on the glucose molecule are located as illustrated in Figure 2.8. Figure 2.8: Electron allocation on the glucose molecule showing that the C atoms have 3 to 5, and an average of 4 electrons for themselves So, hopefully you are now convinced thanks to both the equations and Figure 2.8 that indeed electrons are stored onto organic molecules! Notice that four of the C atoms have 4 electrons for themselves, while one has 3 and the last one has 5. On average though, each atom has 4. This actually is quite interesting as it corresponds to the number of electrons C has on its free form. This means that photosynthesis is not ‘trying’ to store more electrons than what it has in its free form: this is probably a lot more efficient than if it tried to store 6 like for the lipids (see Table 2.1 and Chapter 4), and yet provides an opportunity to store a lot of electrons. Let us take another example with cysteine, which has N and S atoms in it in addition to C and O atoms. You can see in Figure 2.9 that the N and S atoms have 8 electrons for themselves, while the C atoms have 1, 4 and 5 electrons for themselves. Cysteine has thus stored a total of 28 electrons on a total of 5 CNS atoms or 40% more electrons per atom than glucose. Figure 2.9: Electron allocation on the cysteine molecule showing the number of electrons stored on the C, N and S atoms An alga who would use nitrate, sulfate and bicarbonates as its nutrients to anabolize cysteine, would need to find 28 electrons and energy to assemble cysteine, as no electrons come with the nutrients listed here. Interestingly, the electrons stored on N and S in cysteine are not useful as a source of electrons in the respiration chain of heterotrophic respiration. But the N and S atoms, which respectively appear as amine (-NH2) and thiol (-SH) radicals for cysteine in Figure 2.9, play a central role in molecular configuration . This is what the next chapter is going to show. The last example is ATP (Adenosine TriPhosphate), illustrated in Figure 2.10. You can see that there are lots of red dots on the triphosphate side of the molecule, and see that phosphorus has zero electrons for itself…! Chapter 5 details the reasons how and why ATP carries energy. But here, one can see that surely, it is not thanks to electrons on P, since there are none! The triphosphate chain is bound to a ribose, itself bound to an adenine. Ribose + Adenine is called adenosine. On ribose, each carbon stores an average of 4 electrons, like all carbohydrates. There are lots of electrons stored on the 5 atoms of nitrogen on adenine. But these are not used for generating energy in the respiration chain. The large number of N atoms and electrons seem to be associated with highly valued molecules as ATP certainly is. Figure 2.10: Electron allocation on the ATP molecule showing the number of electrons stored on the C, N, and P atoms Last but important point. It is possible that some of you are still wondering why the electrons on oxygen are not counted as the number of electrons stored on molecules, and particularly on organic molecules. Most oxygen atoms, outside of the O2 molecule, have already ‘stolen’ electrons from all other atoms, as we have now repeated quite a few times. So when these molecules are anabolized from molecules such as carbonate, nitrate, sulfate or phosphate, each oxygen atom is already loaded with 8 electrons. So, it cannot accept any additional ones. So each oxygen atom in organic and inorganic molecule, is not bringing any electron ‘to the table’. The only changes can occur on the C, N, and S atoms. 2.9 Summary on electron allocations This concludes the chapter on electron allocation, and the first introduction to oxidation and reduction. We have learned that using the electron allocation rooted in the electronegativity concept, it is possible to visualize where the electrons are stored and realize that in the vast majority of the time: Oxygen ‘steals’ all electrons for itself and is fully reduced, unless it is in the form of O2, where it becomes very ‘hungry’ for electrons Hydrogen being less electronegative, always ‘gives’ its electron to CONS atoms Life’s secret to storing energy boils down to having high-energy electrons stored on C, N, and S atoms, although only the C atoms easily accept or donate electrons. Phosphorus almost always remains in the fully oxidized forms of phosphates (or polyphosphates), even when incorporated in organic molecules as we shall see in the next chapter. This is due to the fact that phosphorus’ electronegativity is lower than that of hydrogen. Phosphate plays a crucial role in energy conveyance, however, thanks to the diphospho anhydride bond. The next step consists in presenting where and why organisms need N, S, and P, to build their structure. The next chapter presents the four molecular families with which all organisms, and therefore organic matter, are assembled. References "],

Looking at these molecules may be a bit scary at first glance: lots of CHONSP everywhere, sometimes linear molecules, sometimes in cycle… No worries, though, the goal of this chapter is to provide the keys to recognize some of the key features of these molecules. Once this is recognized, things can make a lot more sense. And yes, it is important to be able to draw some of these molecules. In reality, there are about half a dozen to learn by heart, and all the other ones can be derived from them for our purposes here. In the previous chapter, we were able to allocate electrons to CHONSP atoms, depending on the bonds together. We realized that oxygen had the central role and essentially was able to take all electrons from any other atoms bonded to it. There are about a dozen functional groups of biochemical significance that are important to recognize. Most of them involve different possibilities of bonds between C and O. Why do we care? Functional groups are associated with chemical and physical properties that make organisms be strong, or rather flexible, attract or repulse water, store or release energy. That is why. 3.1 Hydrocarbon chains First of all, just about all life biochemistry is based on the carbon atom chains. This is where everything starts. It makes a lot of sense because you will discover later that indeed, life uses carbon atoms to store and release energy. So carbon atoms have 4 valence electrons. They can ‘gain’ electrons if they bind with hydrogen atoms, can share electrons when they bind together, or lose their electrons when bonded to O, N, or S. The basis of the organic chemistry needed in ecological and environmental engineering is hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are organic compounds consisted entirely of C and H atoms. 3.1.1 Alkanes Alkanes nomenclature is at the basis of all the naming of organic molecules. Just about all functional groups are essentially variations from the alkane skeleton. They are classified depending on the number of carbons constituting their atom chain, and their chain is always saturated with hydrogen. Saturated with hydrogen? What does this mean? It first means that all bonds are single σ bonds, and second, that valence electrons of the carbon not used for C-C bonds, are shared with the one valence electron of hydrogen atoms to make C-H bonds. This also means that when a carbon chain is saturated with hydrogen, the carbon atoms have all the electrons for themselves. In other words, alkanes or alkane like hydrocarbon chains are the molecules that store the most electrons. Some hydrocarbon chains are called unsaturated when between two carbons, two valence electrons are shared between carbon atoms to form a double or even triple π bond. Each of the two carbons involved are thus called unsaturated with hydrogen. Many commercials in the western world are advertising food with unsaturated fat (Figure 3.1): it just means that some carbons of the hydrocarbon chains of the lipids in the food are unsaturated! But we will discover this a little later. Figure 3.1: Food containing unsaturated fats, reputed to be healthier. obtained at https://healthbeat.spectrumhealth.org/healthy-fats-for-healthy-blood-lipids/ Back to our alkanes. The simplest alkane is methane, made of one carbon atom. Four hydrogen are necessary to fulfill its octet rule and to saturate its carbon (Figure 3.2). Figure 3.2: Lewis dot structure for methane The final formula for methane is thus CH4. The second simplest alkane is ethane, made of two carbon atoms bonded together using two of their valence electrons to make a covalent bond. Hydrogen atoms form bonds with the three valence electrons left on each of the carbon atoms, for a final formula of C2H6, or a condensed formula of CH3-CH3 (Figure 3.3). Figure 3.3: Lewis dot structure for ethane The third simple alkane is propane, made of three carbon atoms in an open chain. The central carbon is bonded to the outer carbons and only has two valence electrons available to bond with H, or for the central carbon to be saturated with hydrogen (Figure 3.4). The final formula of propane is C3H8, or its condensed formula is CH3-CH2-CH3. Figure 3.4: Lewis dot structure for propane The fourth simple alkane is butane (C4H10) with four carbons in its saturated open chain. The two central atoms are saturated with two hydrogen atoms to form a condensed formula of CH3-CH2-CH2-CH3, or CH3-(CH2)2-CH3. The list goes on and on as adding a carbon consists in adding a -CH2- in the middle of the previous chain and in the formula. The general formula for alkanes is thus CnH2n+2. The ‘+2’ in the formula corresponds to the third H on each of the end carbons. In English, Mary Eats Peanut Butter is used as a mnemonic to remember the first four alkanes, as each first letter is the first letter of the respective alkanes. For longer chains, the Greek prefixes are used: pentane (5), hexane (6), heptane (7), octane (8), nonane (9), decane (10), dodecane (12), tetradecane (14), hexadecane (16), octadecane (18), eicosane (20), and docosane (22) to stop there. Table 3.1 summarizes some of the formulae and representations of alkanes. Table 3.1: Alkanes from methane to hexane with condensed and structural formulae, and skeletal structure Number of C and formula Prefix Alkane name and condensed formula Structural formula Skeletal or Line structure 1 CH4 meth- methane CH4 2 C2H6 eth- ethane CH3-CH3 3 C3H8 prop- propane CH3-CH2-CH3 4 C4H10 but- butane CH3-(CH2)2-CH3 5 C5H12 pent- pentane CH3-(CH2)3-CH3 6 C6H14 hex- hexane CH3-(CH2)4-CH3 Looking inside Table 3.1, it now appears that the same molecule can be represented in several ways. First the formula, in the first column where the number of atoms are compiled and added as a subscript near each atom. It is concise, but gives no information on how the atoms are structured together. In the third column, the condensed formula gives more information on how the hydrogen atoms are assembled relative to the carbon atoms. In the propane example, CH3-CH2-CH3 suggests that three hydrogen atoms are bonded to the end carbons, and two H are bonded to the central carbon. By convention, since the hydrogen can only make one bond, it is implied that in CH3-CH2, the hyphen ‘-’ represents the bond between carbons. The structural formula provides a comprehensive illustration of all the bonds and all the atoms. But in organic chemistry, there are so many C and H atoms, that the structural formula becomes too crowded and not easily readable. Chemists have thus decided to simplify the formula representations as much as possible. One very common simplification is the Skeletal structure or line structure representation, illustrated in the fifth column of Table 3.1. As its names suggest, only the carbon skeleton is kept and the rest is implied. Butane for example in Table 3.1 and Figure 3.5 is represented as three angled line segments. It is implied that at the end of each segment, there is a carbon atom, and that each carbon is saturated with hydrogen. The zigzagging of the skeletal structure is also supposed to represent a little bit better how the atoms are thought to actually be intricate together. Actually, if you refer to the summary on electron orbitals, you will see that in alkyl chains, the carbons orbitals are in the sp3 hybridization form, which involves tetraedral shapes, hence the zigzaging. Additionally, because of the sp3 hybridization, the electrons are at their highest energy level! This should ring a bell and confirm that the secret of life to store energy is to store high energy electrons onto organic matter, and precisely onto C, N, and S atoms! All this might appear confusing at the beginning, but this is extremely logical, and helps tremendously when writing or reading molecules important to life and ecological engineering. Figure 3.5: Illustration of the assumptions associated with the correspondence between skeletal structure and structural formula for butane Alkanes provide the basis or skeleton of all other nomenclatures of environmentally relevant organic chemistry. Functional groups correspond in many cases to modifications of the -CH3 or -CH2- where one or several hydrogen atoms are replaced by other atoms, and in other cases to the bonds between two simpler molecules. But before we get there, it is important to address some other important hydrocarbons. 3.1.2 Unsaturated hydrocarbons So what about unsaturated hydrocarbons? As stated before, unsaturated implies that between two carbons, two valence electrons are shared between carbon atoms to form a double or triple π bond. For the majority of the cases of interest for this book, there is only one double bond in the unsaturated hydrocarbon open chains. In this case, the suffix for the molecule name is changed. Instead of -ane for the alkanes, it becomes -ene for what is referred to as the alkenes. In the example of Figure 3.6, the dehydrogenation of carbons 1 and 2 leads to the formation of but-1-ene or α butylene. Figure 3.6: Butene corresponds to the dehydrogenation of butane If you read correctly, you just saw yet another nomenclature for the name. It turns out that 1) where the double bond is located matters very much for the molecule property, and 2) the steric configuration (where the atoms are in space relative to each other) can change dramatically as the double bond is rather rigid, and the atoms are not nearly as free to rotate around the π bond as they are with a σ bond (details in Appendix A). As a result, there are really three possible forms of butene (Figure 3.7). Figure 3.7: The three butene isomers, respectively A: but-1-ene or α butylene,; B: (Z)-but-2-ene or cis-β-butylene; C: (E)-but-2-ene or trans-β-butylene This is honestly outside of the scope of this book, but Figure 3.7 caption points several new nomenclatures. The ‘1’ and ‘2’ in but-1-ene and but-2-ene, and the α and β respectively point to the carbon number that has a double bond. All carbon atoms are given an ordinate number in a hydrocarbon chains (further details later). Then isomers B and C in Figure 3.7 differ by the sides on which the two end -CH3 (referred to as a radical because it is bonded to another carbon, and this radical name is methyl, as it is based on methane that would have lost a hydrogen) are located. The methyl groups are either together, or Zusammen in German, or cis, i.e., on the same side in Latin, or, they are on opposite sides, or Entgegen in German, or trans, i.e., on the other side in Latin. The term butylene is still used today as it is inherited from the French butylène. Unsaturated hydrocarbon chains are rather present in lipids, but also in aromatic hydrocarbons. In the end, saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon chains are referred to as aliphatic hydrocarbons, as opposed to aromatic hydrocarbons. A second family of unsaturated hydrocarbon chains are the alkynes where there is a triple bond between two consecutive carbons. Honestly, this is extremely uncommon in biochemistry of life. The one rather famous molecule is acetylene, which is otherwise named ethyne, i.e., it is a two carbon chain with a triple bond (Table 3.2). 3.1.3 Aromatic hydrocarbons Aromatic hydrocarbons or arenes are cyclic hydrocarbon chains that, as the suffix -ene implies, have at least one double bond between two carbons, but in reality have two or three double bonds. And a hydrocarbon chain with generally alternate single and double bonds that is aromatic is thus called an arene. Aromatic hydrocarbons are ring-shaped, have planar or flat structures, and are considered to be structurally strong molecules and difficult to hydrolyze. Many of these molecules have an aroma or specific odors, hence the name aromatic. The strength and stability of these molecules is at the center of the stiffness of wood thanks to the lignin molecules, which contain lots of aromatic radicals. The following describes in details what at the electron orbital scale causes the aromatic hydrocarbons to have such structural stability. The quintessential model of the aromatic hydrocarbons of concern in biochemistry of life is the benzene ring. It has 6 carbons, with three double bonds, which implies that each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and is unsaturated with hydrogen and thus only has one hydrogen (Figure 3.8). Figure 3.8: Two different resonance forms of benzene (top) combine to produce an average structure (bottom). By Edgar181 - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2962329 Applying the Steric Number (SN) rule described here, SN for each carbon can be calculated as SN = (2 Carbon atoms + 1 hydrogen atom), or SN = 3. This suggests that the electron orbitals for each of the carbon atom are likely hybridized into sp2. This means that each carbon makes a σ bond with the two neighbor carbons, and with the hydrogen atom. This leaves essentially 6 p orbitals that can form double bonds as illustrated in Figure 3.8, or more likely a delocalisation of these electrons into a ring as represented in Figure 3.8. The molecular orbital theory suggests that alternating single and double bonds creates what is referred to as a conjugated pi bond system across multiple atoms, lowers the energy and stabilizes the molecule. Figure 3.9: Benzene sp2 and p orbitals delocalization. Orbital drawning after Vladsinger, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=7531044 For the reasons described above, aromatic molecules are very stable, and do not break apart easily to react with other substances. Many of the aromatic rings in biological systems are based on the benzene ring, to which some of the hydrogens have been replaced by -OH, -CH3, etc. In benzene, each of the carbon atoms has 5 electrons for itself, slightly less than the 6 or 7 electrons available on carbons of the alkane molecules. Five electrons is more than the average carbohydrate carbon (4), and should theoretically be rather ‘attractive’ to energy releasing processes such as microbiological respiration. However, the delocalization of the p orbitals makes this molecule very stable and very difficult to break apart, and therefore rather ‘unattractive’ instead for energy release purposes, but extremely attractive for structural strength ones. Etymology Corner The prefix benz- in benzene is associated with the benzoin resin, which is a dried exudation from pierced bark of trees of the genus Styrax (Styracaceae) mostly native from East and Southeast Asia (Sumatra, Java, Thailand), and used in perfumes, some kinds of incense, as a flavoring, and medicine (Wikipedia contributors 2019b). Benzoin resin is known from European pharmacists and perfumers since the 15th century. The word benzoin seems to be an oral transcription of the Arabic Lubān jāwī (لبان جاوي), which translates into Javan Frankincense (Wikipedia contributors 2019b), suggesting that the Arabs have known and traded this resin for a long time, along with many other types of Frankincense. To make things more complete and possibly confusing, the French chemist Auguste Laurent, named the same benzene substance phène in reference to the Greek word φαινω which means ‘I light’ as this substance was obtained from gases used for street lighting (Laurent 1836). This is the reason for the word phenol otherwise referred to as hydroxy-benzene and for the radical -phenyl described below. It turns out that in addition to purely hydrocarbon arenes, there are aromatic compounds with other atoms than just C and H, that are derived from benzene, and are non-benzene based. They are referred to as heteroarenes or heterocyclic compounds. In simple rings, there tend to be 5 to 6 atom rings where most of the atoms are carbons. It is not possible to avoid these because they play a crucial role in the chemistry of life, particularly for RNA and DNA. The rules for aromaticity are described in details by Hückel’s rules, but for this book, one should remember that aromatic compounds are cyclic, planar, and have delocalized π orbitals which gives them strength and stability. Figure 3.10: Homoarene benzene and three heteroarenes or heterocyclic hydrocarbons, including pyrimidine, imidazole, the combination of both forming purine. (with the H added, top, and without the H, bottom) Notice in Figure 3.10 that it is implied that there is a lone pair of electrons not part of any covalent bond for the nitrogen atoms. Each nitrogen atom must always have three bonds in organic molecules. Replacing two of the benzene carbons with nitrogen atoms yields pyrimidine. Additions of simple radicals and functional groups to this molecule is at the basis of the nitrogenous bases named pyrimidines used in the RNA and DNA. Removing a carbon from pyrimidine yields imidazole, and combining a pyrimidine with an imidazole yields a purine. And yes, purines are the other types of nitrogenous bases used in the RNA and DNA. Important aromatic molecules indeed! Equipped with the alkane, alkene, and aromatic hydrocarbon skeleton, it is now time to explore the common and important functional groups relevant to the biochemistry of life. There are essentially two types of functional groups, the ones existing on elementary alkane skeleton hydrocarbon resulting from the oxidation of one or several carbons of the alkane original molecule, and the ones resulting from the binding of elementary functionalized hydrocarbon chains. The following paragraphs present the important functional groups on elementary hydrocarbons. 3.2 Functional groups from alkane chain oxidation The first set of principal functional groups relevant to biochemistry are summarized in Figure 3.11. The functional groups can be classified depending on the number of electrons that the carbon on the original alkane molecule (or more precisely the alkyl radical) may have lost to oxidation: 2, 4, or 6 (Figure 3.11). Figure 3.11: Functional groups resulting from the differential oxidation (loss of 2, 4, and 6 electrons to O, S, and N) of an original alkyl carbon atom. Notice that the number of electrons stored on the carbon atom are illustrated in dark blue Losing two electrons to either oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen, generates alcohol (-CH2OH), thiol (-CH2SH), and alkyl amine (-CH2NH2) functional groups, respectively. When O, S, and N only ‘steal’ two electrons from the alkyl carbon, they are in the form of hydroxyl (-OH), sulfanyl (-SH), or amine (-NH2), all of which are also considered as functional groups. Only oxygen can steal four electrons from carbon at once, to form aldehyde (-CHO when the carbon is an end carbon) or ketone (-CO- when the carbon is not an end carbon) functional groups. Within aldehydes and ketone, one can isolate the group C=O, which is then referred to as the carbonyl functional group, and the -C=O, which is then referred to as an acyl functional group (Figure 3.11). An aldehyde is thus an acyl group bonded to a hydrogen. An aldehyde is also a carbonyl group bonded to an alkyl radical (the open ended bond to the left) and a hydrogen. The carbonyl, acyl, hydroxyl, sulfanyl groups are thus identified to ease the description of organic molecules, and even of functional groups (further details later). Losing six electrons automatically implies that the alkyl carbon has lost four to oxygen to form a carbonyl group, and, has then lost two additional carbons, either to oxygen to form a carboxyl or carboxylic acid group, or to nitrogen to form an amide group (Figure 3.11). 3.2.1 Hydroxyl and sulfanyl functional groups We have now used the word radical several times. Technically in chemistry, a radical is an atom, molecule, or ion that has an unpaired valence electron. The radical hydroxyl is and misses one valence electron. The hydroxy (without the ‘l’) functional group is -OH, implying that the hydroxyl radical is bonded to another atom. Hydroxy groups are very common in biochemistry of life. In reality, although the difference between hydroxyl and hydroxy group seems to be the proper nomenclature agreed upon by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry - IUPAC, most chemistry books often used the expression ‘hydroxyl group’ and use the suffix ‘-yl’ for functional groups. Hydroxy groups are most often involved in alcohol and carboxylic acid functional groups. The sulfanyl group -SH is the analog of the hydroxyl group. Oxygen and sulfur are on the same column in the periodic table (Figure 2.1) and have 6 valence electrons. Sulfur is less electronegative and does not readily ‘steal’ electrons as oxygen does. The sulfanyl functional group is involved in the thiol functional group. 3.2.2 Amine functional group In organic chemistry, amines are compounds and functional groups that contain a basic nitrogen atom with a lone pair. Amines are formally derivatives of ammonia, wherein one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced by a substituent such as an alkyl or aryl group (Wikipedia contributors 2019d). Amines, very much like alcohols, are classified into primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, depending on the number of alkyl groups bonded to the nitrogen atom. The substituent -NH2 is called an amino group, hence the name amino-acids described in the next chapter (Figure 3.12). The nitrogen of amines almost always has 8 electrons for itself in organic molecules. For primary producers, amines are formed and incorporated into organic molecules directly from the uptake of ammonium, or, after the reduction of nitrate uptaken. Notice the tetrahedral shape of ammonia and amines Figure 3.12: Ammonia and conjugate acid ammonium, and identified primary, secondary, and tertiary amines Etymology Corner The suffix of amine comes from the French suffix -ine, used to form words for derived substances. Amines are thus derived substances of ammonia or ammonium. Both words in English come from the sal ammoniac which is a rare natural salt made of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). In history, this salt was exported from the hammoniacum region of the Roman province of Cyrenaica in present-day Libya. The Roman name hammoniacum actually comes from the Greek word Ammon. The Greeks have given this name to the Siwa oasis, known for its salt exports, in the middle of the vast sea of sand of the Lybian desert. The word Ammon is a contraction of the Greek word Ammos which means sand, and the name of the god from the nomadic tribes worshiped at Siwa, the Ram God Amon, identified at one point with the Egyptian god Amun Ra, and eventually revered as the king of gods. The mix of the part-Greek, part-Egyptian, and part-Libyan Ram god with the Greek Zeus, lead to Zeus-Ammon or Jupiter Ammon, god with a human head with the horns of a ram. The oracle of the god Ammon was located in the Siwa oasis. The sal ammoniac was particularly used for worshiping at that temple. The Greek word Ammon seems to be a voluntary play on words with Ammos, which means sand. So Ammon was the Zeus of the sand. And this is why there are two ‘m’ to the words ammonia and ammonium. It is unclear why the ‘c’ of ammoniac was dropped in English. The ‘c’ reappears in the expression Total Ammoniacal Nitrogen or TAN, which is used in some analytical laboratories and corresponds to the summation of ammonia and ammonium forms in solution. 3.2.3 Carbonyl and acyl functional groups Very much like for hydroxyl and sulfanyl, the carbonyl and acyl groups have been given a name to ease the description of molecules or other functional groups, and are often part of larger functional groups. As described above and illustrated in Figure 3.11, the carbonyl is a carbon double bonded to an oxygen (C=O). The acyl group (-C=O) is a moiety, i.e., part of a molecule, of other functional groups such as aldehyde (-CHO) or carboxylic acids. Acyl groups can have long aliphatic chains on the left of -C=O, particularly when it corresponds to fatty acid residues in lipid molecules (details in section 4.5.3). 3.2.4 Alcohol functional group In chemistry, an alcohol is any organic compound in which the hydroxy functional group (–OH) is bound to a carbon. Most of alcohol groups in organic chemistry are secondary alcohols, which means that the alcohol functional groups -CHOH- are usually embedded in longer carbon chains. Chemists make differences between the number of hydrogens that are bonded to the -COH radical (Figure 3.13). As presented in Figure 3.11, the carbon of alcohol functional groups still have 4 electrons for themselves, which corresponds to the number of valence electrons on C at the natural state. The glucose molecule, out of 6 carbon atoms, has 5 alcohol functional groups! On the nomenclature side, the condensed formula for the primary structure is -CH2OH, and for the secondary structure is -CHOH-. In the condensed formula, the hydroxyl radical OH is purposely separated from the rest to point out that this is an alcohol functional group. The naming convention is to use the alkane prefix with the suffix -ol at the end. An alcohol of propane would be called propanol. A propane with two or three alcohol functional groups would be called propan-di-ol or propan-tri-ol, respectively. Figure 3.13: Generic alcohol functional group and the identified primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols Etymology Corner The etymology of alcohol seems to be rather obscure. It certainly comes from the Arabic kohl (كحل), ‘al’ standing for the article of kohl. Kohl refers to as an eyewash lotion, and a very fine and very pure powder used as eye shadow for a long time, possibly by the Egyptians and reported as early as 1278 in Spain. The migration of the meaning of the word from of the ‘very fine and very pure powder’ to the ‘spirit of wine’ obtained by ‘very fine and very pure’ reiterated distillation is unclear. The Swiss chemist Paracelsus is generally given as the author in the XVIth century of the migration of the meaning of the word towards the ‘spirit of wine’, or ethanol and as we understand it today. 3.2.5 Thiol functional group Thiols are the sulfur analogue of alcohols (that is, sulfur takes the place of oxygen in the hydroxyl group of an alcohol), and the word is [the combination] of “thio-” + “alcohol”, with the first word deriving from Greek θεῖον (theion) meaning “sulfur” (Wikipedia contributors 2019g). Figure 3.14: Thiol group (left) is the analogue of the hydroxyl group of an alcohol (right) As the functional group of the amino acid cysteine, the thiol group plays a very important role in biology. When the thiol groups of two cysteine residues (as in monomers or constituent units) are brought near each other in the course of protein folding, an oxidation reaction can generate a cysteine unit with a disulfide bond (−S−S−). Disulfide bonds can contribute to a protein’s tertiary structure if the cysteines are part of the same peptide chain, or contribute to the quaternary structure of multi-unit proteins by forming fairly strong covalent bonds between different peptide chains (Wikipedia contributors 2019g). This is presented in more details in the dedicated chapter on proteins The naming convention is to use the alkane name with the suffix -thiol at the end. A thiol of propane would be called propanethiol. 3.2.6 Alkyl amines Alkyl amines are another analogue of alcohols in the sense that an amine functional group replaces a hydroxyl group. The most important molecules where amines exist in biochemistry are amino acids as previously stated. For the anecdote, there are polyamine molecules, two of which are diamines called putrescine (butane-1,4-diamine) and cadaverine (pentane-1,4-diamine). They respectively have a butane and a pentane skeleton with an amine group on the two end carbons. And you guessed it, they have to do with cadavers. They are foul-smelling diamine compound produced by the putrefaction of animal tissue. The naming convention is to use the alkane prefix with the suffix -amine at the end. An amine of propane would be called propanamine. Actually, this naming refers to the fact that an amine has been added to a propane. Another naming is that a propyl radical (CH3-CH2-CH2-) has been added to an amine. In that case, it would be called a propyl-amine. The first naming is alkyl centric, and the other is functional group centric. In the end, both naming are correct and accepted. 3.2.7 Aldehyde functional group Aldehyde functional group consists in a carbonyl group with the carbon atom also bonded to hydrogen. This implies that aldehyde groups are necessarily at the end of an hydrocarbon chain. To differentiate between alcohol and aldehyde groups, the condensed formula for an aldehyde is -CHO. The carbon of an aldehyde functional group has lost 4 electrons to oxygen, and only has 3 for itself (Figure 3.15). Because of the electronegativity of the carbonyl group, aldehyde group are rather polarized, which makes them rather soluble in polar solvent such as water. The general naming convention is to replace the -e of the alkane name with the suffix -al at the end. An aldehyde of propane would be called propanal. Many fragrances (odors, aroma) are aldehyde molecules. The word aldehyde was coined by Justus von Liebig as a contraction of the Latin alcohol dehydrogenatus (dehydrogenated alcohol). Figure 3.15: Generic aldehyde functional group with the allocation of the electrons to oxygen and carbon atoms 3.2.8 Ketone functional group Ketone functional group consists in a carbonyl group included in the middle of a hydrocarbon chain. The condensed formula for a ketone is -CO-, or sometimes written as -(C=O)-. The carbon of a ketone functional group has lost 4 electrons to oxygen, and only has 2 for itself (Figure 3.16). Figure 3.16: Generic ketone functional group with the allocation of the electrons to oxygen and carbon atoms The general naming convention is to replace the -e of the alkane name with the suffix -one at the end. A ketone of propane would be called propanone. Etymology Corner The English word ketone comes from the German Aketon, itself derived from the French acétone. The French chemist Antoine Bussy proposed to add the suffix -one to products of some his distillation experiments. One of which was obtained by the dry distillation of acetic acid (ethanoic acid), which he then named acétone (Bussy 1833). This can be somewhat confusing because acetic acid is a C2 and acétone is a C3 hydrocarbon… But science is rooted in history too! 3.2.9 Carboxyl functional group The carboxyl group (properly called carboxy group by the IUPAC, but every text book uses interchangeably carboxyl radical and carboxyl group), is an aldehyde group that would have lost two additional electrons to oxygen via an hydroxyl group (Figure 3.17). The condensed formula for a carboxyl group is -COOH. The carboxyl group is always at the end of a hydrocarbon chain, in which case the group is referred to as a carboxylic acid. Yes, you read correctly, with the carboxyl group, we are entering the world of acid and base, pH, etc. But why so? Figure 3.17: Generic carboxyl functional group with the allocation of the electrons to oxygen and carbon atoms Looking at the top row of Figure 3.17, it is obvious that there is plethora of electrons for the carboxyl group, all captured by the two oxygen atoms. However, the level of energy to maintain contiguous double bond of the carbonyl and the single bond of the hydroxyl groups is higher than when the hydroxyl group loses a proton H+, leaving the oxygen of the hydroxyl group to be negative. Without the hydrogen, the extra electron can, with the π electrons of the double bond of the carbonyl group, be delocalized (bottom row of Figure 3.17). This is not too distant from the aromatic molecules, in that the -COO- end is rather stable. This explains why the carboxyl group behaves as an acid as it can readily release an H+ in solution. The stability of the carboxylic acid form (-COOH) versus its conjugate base form (carboxylate -COO-) depends on the pH of the solution and is discussed in the dedicated acid-base chapter. Because of the density of electrons near the oxygen atoms, the functional group is very polar, even in its acid form, and rather hydrophylic. The general naming convention for the carboxyl group is two fold. For the acidic form (-COOH), it is to replace the -e of the alkane name with the suffix -oic acid at the end. A carboxylic acid of propane would be called propanoic acid. For the anionic form (-COO-), the naming convention is to replace the -e of the alkane name with the suffix -oate at the end. The anion form of a carboxylic acid of propane would be called propanoate. 3.2.10 Amide functional group The amide functional group can be seen as a derivative of carboxylic acid where the hydroxyl group is replaced by the amine functional group. In that case, it can be seen as an oxidation of a single carbon of an alkyl radical. In reality, for most amide groups, at least one of the hydrogen of the amine group is replaced by another hydrocarbon chain, as illustrated in Figure 3.18 below. In that case, amides can be seen as assemblages of functionalized molecules described in the next section. Figure 3.18: Generic amide functional groups, with the allocation of the electrons to oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon atoms. Because oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen, and because of the double π bond of the carbonyl (C=O) group, the lone pair available on the nitrogen tends to be delocalized into the carbonyl group, forming a partial double bond between nitrogen and the carbonyl group (Figure 3.19). Figure 3.19: Generic amide functional groups, with the allocation of the electrons to oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon atoms. This forms an electron resonance system that is rather stable. In fact, experience shows that the amide functional group is planar without free rotation about the C-N bond, which fits well with the resonance structure and the partial double bond between C and N. This property actually has some fantastic consequences in the chemistry of life. The amide functional group corresponds to the peptidic bond existing between consecutive amino acids in a protein (details in section 4.3 dedicated to proteins). In other words, because of the resonance structure and the partial double bond of the amide functional group, hence its strong and planar structure, proteins can take a specific and rigid structure in three dimensions. The amide functional group is present in sphingolipids and make these molecules a lot more rigid than of membrane lipids, and thus play a role in the insertion of proteins in membranes (details in section 4.5.6). This paragraph completes the list of principal functional groups of major importance for biochemistry. This list is not exhaustive but sufficient for the goals of this book. Do it yourself! Time to practice and draw molecules and functional groups! We are lucky to have great tools available to draw molecules that makes all of this playful really. One of which is extremely interesting as it allies the building of the molecules and have automatic info on the name, and properties of the molecules! The tool I propose to use is JSME, standing for JavaScript Molecule Editor. I made a very simple tutorial on how this editor works in the following video. Now that you have a minimal understanding of how the editor works, the goal is to draw some functional groups and get familiar with them, so that you may identify them. In the following video, I illustrated how to draw the principal functional groups described in the first part of this chapter. After this video, it will be your turn to play. In the first tutorial, I mentioned that a molecule drawn can be exported as a univocal code. There are several accepted codes. One of which is the SMILES code, standing for Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System. In the following exercises, you are asked to draw molecules in the editor, and I give the answers in SMILES code, so that you may check your answer. So go to this JSME demonstration page and draw the molecules below. You can get the SMILES code by either clicking on the smiley icon, or, by clicking on the box with the blue triangles facing each other. You can then compare your answers to the ones below. Your turn to play! Draw a molecule of propanoic acid (Ans: CC(=O)O ) Draw a molecule of butyl amine (Ans: CCCCN ) Draw a molecule of propane-tri-ol (Ans: OCC(O)CO ).

Figure 3.20 below summarizes the principal complex functional groups resulting from the binding of two simple functional groups. It becomes very apparent that the alcohol and carboxyl functional groups play, with phosphate, a preponder role in the formation of complex functional groups, and in the binding of simple molecules together to form more complex ones. Each of the groups are presented in more details below. Figure 3.20: Complex functional groups resulting from the combination of simple functional groups illustrating the preponderant role of alcohol, carboxylic acid and phosphate 3.3.1 Ester functional group Esters are common in organic chemistry and biological materials, and often have a pleasant characteristic, fruity odor. Ester functional groups are formed from the condensation reaction between a carboxylic acid and an alcohol group (Figure 3.21). Because of the electronegativity of the oxygen and the double π bond of the carbonyl, the hydroxyl group in the carboxyl group reacts with the hydrogen of the alcohol group to form the ester bond. The ester bond is essential in biochemistry particularly for lipids. Figure 3.21: Esterification: condensation reaction between a carboxylic acid with an alcohol Esters are named as if the alkyl chain from the alcohol is a substituent. This is followed by the name of the parent chain from the carboxylic acid part of the ester with an –e remove and replaced with the ending –oate. There are more subtil naming conventions from esters, particularly when the carbon bonded to the ester bond in the substituent chain is not an end carbon, but this is unimportant for our goal here. Additional naming nomenclature details can be found here. Figure 3.22: The substituent alkyl chain from the alcohol is a propyl. The parent chain name with a carboxyl group is ethanoic acid, which in the ester bond, becomes ethanoate. In the end the name of the molecule is propylethanoate 3.3.2 Thioesters Following the analogy between alcohol and thiol functional groups, thioesters are the analogue of esters. Thioester functional groups are formed from the condensation reaction between a carboxylic acid and a thiol group (Figure 3.23). Figure 3.23: Thioesterification: condensation reaction between a carboxylic acid with a thiol. Notice the skwiggly blue line illustrating an energy bond. In the thioester functional group, there are a great number of somewhat mobile electrons next to each other, namely through the double oxygen bond, and thanks to the sulfur atom, which has d orbitals. As a result, the C-S bond (C of the carbonyl (C=O)) is reputed to be unstable because of the electronic repulsion, and was often represented with the tilde (~) sign in the past (Lipmann 1941) and misnamed ‘high energy bond’. In reality, it is the hydrolysis of the thioester bond that releases energy, i.e., that is exergonic (more details in section dedicated to ATP). This suggests that another source of energy is needed to make the C-S bond in the first place. This is detailed in this chapter. This property is paramount and explains the central role or the major thioester example in biochemistry, i.e., the famous acetyl-coA. This complicated molecule’s function is to deliver the acetyl group to the Krebs cycle to be oxidized for energy production. The acronym coA stands for coenzyme A, i.e., a non-protein enzyme. 3.3.3 Phosphoesters The second analogue to esters are the phosphoesters. This time, the carboxylic acid is replaced by a phosphoric acid H3PO4. In reality, depending on the pH, the actual form of the acid might be H2PO4-, HPO42-, or PO43- (Figure 2.7), all of which are loosely referred to as ‘phosphates’ (details in section 10 dedicated to acid-base reactions). So phosphates can react with alcohol functional groups to form phosphoester bonds (Figure 3.24). Figure 3.24: Phosphoesterification: condensation reaction between a phosphate with an alcohol The most famous phosphoester bond is actually the phosphodiester bond that binds nucleotides together in the RNA and DNA molecules. Etymology Corner The word ester has been coined by German chemist Leopold Gmelin in the 1820s. For some, this is a “pure invention” from Gmelin; others suggest that it is a contraction from the German Essigäther name for ethyl acetate, from Essig which means vinegar and Äther, which means ether. Ethyl acetate has a fruity pleasant smell. It is likely that Gmelin used the word ester after the famously beautiful Queen Esther from the Book of Esther in the Hebrew Bible. The word ether was first introduced by the German-born chemist Frobenius in 1729 (Frobenius 1729) when describing the properties of diethyl ether and he named this substance “Spiritus Vini Æthereus”. The word Æthereus most likely refers to the volatility of ethers rising to the sky. The Latin word aethēr from Ancient Greek αἰθήρ (aithḗr) refers to the “highest and purest part of the atmosphere, to air, heavens, sky, light of day, but also ethereal matter surrounding a deity” (“Ether - Wiktionary,” n.d.). This corresponds to the time when the ancients did not know about the vacuum of space and named æther the medium supposed to fill unoccupied space above the atmosphere and able to transmit heat and light. 3.3.4 Ether functional group Ether functional group result from the condensation reaction between two alcohol groups (Figure 3.25). Ethers are very volatile compounds. Diethyl ether (CH3-CH2-O-CH2-CH3) is commonly refer to as ether by itself. It is a volatile flammable liquid and has been used as anesthetic for a long time. Its side effects of post-anesthetic nausea and vomiting have made it seldom used in the XXIst century. Figure 3.25: Etherification: condensation reaction between two alcohols Ether functional group is extremely common in carbohydrates, although it is referred to as the glycosidic bond then because there is at least one carbohydrate involved. 3.3.5 Hemiacetal and hemiketal functional groups A hemiacetal or a hemiketal is a compound that results from the addition of an alcohol to an aldehyde or a ketone, respectively. Hemiacetal and hemiketal groups are extremely important in biology as they are responsible for the cycling of carbohydrate monomers! The prefix hemi- which means half in Greek, suggests that this is only half a reaction. An acetal or ketal would be the full reaction, but this is besides the point because the hemiacetal and hemiketal are the important groups in biochemistry. Figure 3.26: Addition of an alcohol nucleophile to a ketone or aldehyde forms an hemiketal and hemiactal functional group, respectively As illustrated in Figure 3.26, there is an asymetry in these two functional groups, with a hydroxyde group above and an alkyl ether group at the bottom. This asymetry is one of the reasons why these functional groups are not very stable theoretically. However in cyclic molecules like glucose (Figure 3.27) or fructose (Figure 3.28), these functional groups are stable, yet easily reversible. Figure 3.27: Intramolecular cyclic hemiacetal formation in glucose and more generally for pyranose hexoses Figure 3.28: Intramolecular cyclic hemiketal formation in fructose and more generally for furanose hexoses This property is essential and explains why glucose can, when polymerized, form cellulose, a stable fiber, and, be easily transformed into its linear not cyclic form where it can be hydrolized for energy generation! More details in section 4.2.1. 3.3.6 Anhydride and phosphoanhydride functional groups The condensation reaction between two carboxylic acids leads to the formation of the anhydride functional group (Figure 3.29). Honestly, this functional group is not particularly common in biochemistry. Figure 3.29: Condensation reaction between two carboxylic acids results in the formation of an anhydride functional group However, its phosphorus analogue has a major role in the biochemistry of life. The condensation of a phosphate and a carboxylic acid yields a phosphoanhydride bond (see Table 3.2). The condensation of two phosphates yields a diphospho anhydride bond (Figure 3.30). Figure 3.30: Condensation reaction between two phosphates results in the formation of a phosphoanhydride functional group. The resulting two phosphate molecule is called a pyrophosphate. The skwiggly blue line has been added to show that the hydrolysis of the anhydride bond releases energy Similarly to thioesters, and at a higher energy level, the concentration of electrons at the diphospho anhydride bond creates great instability between bonded phosphate tetrahedra (Degens 1989). As a result, the hydrolysis of this bond is exergonic and releases energy. This has been represented in Figure 3.30 above with a skiggly line. Many biochemists have banned the used of this skwiggly line (e.g., Moran 2012) and the concept of ‘high enrgy bond’ introduced by Lipmann in (1941) and represented as a “~”, as it gave the false impression that the bond in itself had a high energy, which it does not. We have decided to use another skwiggly representation to show the instability of this linkage and hence the energy release during hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of one of the diphospho anhydride bond is the fundamental principle for the release of energy from ATP, Adenosine Tri-Phosphate, producing an ADP (Adenosine Di-Phosphate) and a phosphate group. ATP can be formed from the assemblage again of ADP plus a phosphate. The source of energy for reassembling ATP is mechanical at the molecular scale (details in section 5.2 dedicated to ATP and energy). Do it yourself! Go to cheminfo.org/wikipedia page and draw the molecules listed below. You can get the SMILES code by either clicking on the smiley icon, or, by clicking on the box with the blue triangles facing each other. You can then compare your answers to the ones below. This time, there is a direct link between the molecule you draw and several thousands of molecules listed in Wikipedia. Not all possible molecules are listed in Wikipedia, and the program finds the closest molecule. Verify that the number of carbons on the drawing does correspond to the ones listed on the molecule found by Wikipedia. Your turn to play!

Find the two diphosphoanhydride bonds, and the adenine part of the molecule (purine with an anmine group) Draw this molecule (CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O), and identify the benzoic acid, the acetoxy group, and the ester bond. Guess the name of this very common molecule! 3.4 Summary on functional groups and important radicals The list provided above is not exhaustive, but enough to identify most functional groups in organic molecules associated with the biochemistry of life. The names of these functional groups are used throughout this book and this chapter has been designed to serve as a reference when in doubt. In addition to functional groups, there are several molecules or radicals, which are very common and must be known. They are illustrated in Figure 3.31. The phenyl radical is a benzene ring. The reason for the name is explain in an etymology corner before. Phenol is an hydroxy benzene. Acetic acid is the acid in vinegar and is also named ethanoic acid. The base conjugate is called acetate or ethanoate. Glycerol is a propane-triol and serves as a skeleton to lipids where it forms ester bonds with fatty acids. Glyceraldehyde is a glycerol for which one carbon has been oxidized into an aldehyde. The phosphated version of glyceraldehyde, i.e., glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (3 because the phosphoester bond is on the third carbon of the glyceraldehyde) or more commonly referred to as G3P, is generally considered the prime end-product of photosynthesis. Glucose is then assembled from two G3P. Pyruvate, the base conjugate of pyruvic acid, is the end-product of the glycolysis, i.e., the first step in the oxidation of glucose requiring no exogenous electron acceptor. A list of for acid and acyl radicals commonly found in biochemistry can also be found at this site, and more generally the nomenclature of organic chemistry can be found on the IUPAC nomenclature website. Figure 3.31: Very common molecules and radicals that have special names in addition to the IUPAC ones Finally, the functional groups of importance are summarized in Table 3.2 and an example is given to each one when applicable.

Details of each are summarized in this chapter In organic molecules, about 4 electrons are stored on each carbon atom, none on the phosphorus, and always 8 electrons on the nitrogen and sulfur atoms 4.1 Polymers of simple monomers When scientists of the 18th century observed nature, they thought there had to be major differences between animated organisms and the inanimate ones. In fact they thought that the elements at the basis of the animated vs. inanimate things had to be different. One can only wonder at the incredible diversity and complexity of forms between a bacterium and humans, and between unicellular algae and sequoia trees! And yet, despite the incredible variations of life forms and sizes, there is a common theme: very complex organic molecules correspond to the assemblage of simple molecules and in many cases are polymers of relatively simple monomers. In the image of a brick wall and the skyscraper in Figure 4.1, it is possible to make a small wall or a huge skyscraper. Brick walls are made of bricks and of mortar to hold the bricks together. If one adds metal pieces, wood, etc. the complexity of the final product can be infinite, yet it is made from simple elementary pieces. Figure 4.1: Small and large structures can be built from the addition of bricks, one at a time Living organisms are essentially made of very complex polymers, but which are in most cases built from simple monomers. Just like in a building which complexity results from the assemblage of different types of material, e.g., bricks, wood, metal, etc., living organisms are assembled from distinct ‘types of molecules’. Among the very complex organic polymers, one can distinguish four molecular families. Molecular families can be identified because within a family, there are polymers of similar monomers the monomers are distinct between families and there tends to be unique chemical bonds between consecutive monomers allowing polyremisation. The vast majority of the organic matter that makes cells and organisms have been classified into four molecular families: Carbohydrates Proteins Nucleic acids Lipids Before we get into the details of each family, Table 4.1 below summarizes some of the major attributes of each of the molecular family. Although the CHONSP elements constitute organic matter in general, no one family is constituted of all these six atoms! Carbohydrates and lipids are mostly made of CHO, with additional N and P for lipids. Proteins are the only molecules where S is present. Carbohydrates and lipids play a major role in energy storage and cellular structure, while nucleic acids only store and transcribe the genetic information, and this information is transcribed into very precise sequence of amino acids forming proteins and giving them their functions.

The generic formula for carbohydrates is (CH2O)n, and each atom, on average, has 4 electrons for itself as illustrated in Figure 4.2. We have seen in the previous chapter that having 4 electrons stored on each C is probably the most cost effective way to store many electrons on organic molecules. Figure 4.2: Electron allocation of a generic carbohydrate (CH2O)n Carbohydrates are a rather homogeneous group as they include clearly identified monomers and polymers of these monomers. Most monomers (monolignols being a notable exception) are C6 or C5 rings and can, depending on their nature and on their polymerization type, serve very different purposes including energy storage (e.g., starch), structure (e.g., cellulose or chitin of cructacean shells), or as backbone of RNA (e.g., ribose). On an everyday life basis, carbohydrates are present in paper, sugar, pasta, grain, etc (some common carbohydrates in food illustrated in Figure 4.3). Figure 4.3: Assortment of everyday food containing carbohydrates. Obtained from https://www.measureup.com.au/all-about-carbohydrates/ 4.2.1 Monosaccharides The monomers of carbohydrates are called monosaccharides (from Greek monos, i.e., single, and sacchar, sugar) or called simple sugars or oses (from the Latin “full of, abounding in, having qualities of”). The monomers that are assembled into complex polymers generally are hexoses, that is that they have 6 carbons, and are isomers of glucose. However, monosaccharides do include more than just hexoses or C6H12O6, and it is important to present them in general, and not just the monomers of polysaccharides. Most monosaccharides are made of 3 to 6 carbons (there actually are C7 to C9 oses) and are classified in aldoses or ketoses, depending on whether they have a aldehyde (-CHO) on their C#1 or a ketone (C=O) radical, usually on the carbon numbered #2 (details on these functional groups in sections 3.2.7 and 3.2.8). They either exist in linear chains and are then represented in Fischer projection like in Figures 4.4 and 4.5, or, for pentoses (C5) and hexoses (C6), exist in cyclic chains (Figures 4.11 and 4.10). Carbohydrates have been given a lot of codes and naming conventions and it is hard to avoid them if we want to put things together. So, do not be scared by all the names and letters used to describe and differentiate carbohydrates. The goal is: to realize the large diversity of monosaccharides to realize that the differences between, e.g., the hexoses are of steric consideration, i.e., which side are the hydroxyl (-OH) groups of the linear chain, right or left. to realize that C5 and C6 carbohydrates alternate between chain and cyclic molecular configurations. The cyclic form prevails for the functions of transport and structure that the carbohydrates provide. The chain form is the form needed for the release of electrons and energy. Both forms interchange freely for monosaccharides. Figure 4.4: classification of C3 to C6 aldoses in Fischer projection. Triose : (1) D-(+)-glyceraldehyde ; Tetroses : (2a) D-(−)-erythrose ; (2b) D-(−)-threose ; Pentoses : (3a) D-(−)-ribose ; (3b) D-(−)-arabinose ; (3c) D-(+)-xylose ; (3d) D-(−)-lyxose ; Hexoses : (4a) D-(+)-allose ; (4b) D-(+)-altrose ; (4c) D-(+)-glucose ; (4d) D-(+)-mannose ; (4e) D-(−)-gulose ; (4f) D-(−)-idose ; (4g) D-(+)-galactose ; (4h) D-(+)-talose. after Yikrazuul — personal work, public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4030124 Time to incorporate some jargon. When in the chain form necessary for the carbons to donate their electrons, monosaccharides are called reducing sugars. This means that they are able to donate their electrons, to drive respiration and the generation of energy in the cell (details in Chapter 5). So, despite the fact that each carbon atom on monosaccharides has 4 electrons to give, potentially, this does not systematically happen. Strange, is it not? Indeed, for the pentoses and hexoses to be reducing sugars, they must be in the aldose form, or have a free aldehyde at the end of their chain or on carbon #1. So this rules out the ketoses? Actually no, the ketoses in the chain form can be readily tautomerized into aldoses. This is only important to explain some of the differences in disaccharides. Figure 4.5: classification of C3 to C6 ketoses in Fischer projection. Triose : (1) dihydroxyacetone ; Tetrose : (2) D-erythrulose ; Pentoses : (3a) D-ribulose ; (3b) D-xylulose ; Hexoses : (4a) D-psicose ; (4b) D-fructose ; (4c) D-sorbose ; (4d) D-tagatose. after Yikrazuul — personal work, public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6603584 You might wonder what the D-(+) or D-(-) might mean in the legends of Figures 4.4 and 4.5… This is due to optical rotation properties that a pure solution of a particular ose has because of the asymmetry of the molecules. The different forms of hexoses in, e.g., Figure 4.4 are called eniantiomers. D means that the hydroxyl group on the C#n-1 to the right of the molecule and most natural oses tend to be D (few oses have it on the left, in which case they are coded as L). The (+) or (-) tell whether the light rotation is pulled towards positive or negative angles. OK, lots of terms here, mostly to quench some of the curiosity of the biochemist in you. Now that we have a more holistic view of what monosaccharides are made of, for all our purposes, we will reduce all this great variability to a few of them, which are glyceraldehyde (C3), ribose and deoxyribose (C5), and, glucose and fructose (C6). Glyceraldehyde is an important intermediate molecule of photosynthesis. We have seen the glycerol molecule in section 3.4, which is a propan-tri-ol, or three hydroxyl group on each of the 3 carbons. For glyceraldehyde, an end alcohol group is oxidized to an aldehyde group. Figure 4.6: Fisher projection (left) and skeletal formula (right) of D-glyceraldehyde Hexose and pentose monosaccharides have two main roles: an energy release role when they are in their linear form, and a structural role when they are in their cyclic configuration as they serve as structural moeities (pentoses) and as the elementary monomers for the construction of disaccharides or more complex carbohydrates (hexoses). This might, admitedly, sound a little odd, as one might have the idea that a molecule is a rather stable physical entity. In their linear form, they can be incorporated into the metabolic pathway of cells where the electrons stored on the carbons can be released. A ‘sugar’ (i.e., the generic term also used to describe carbohydrates) that has the ability to act as a reducing agent because it has a free aldehyde group or a free ketone group, is referred to as a reducing sugar. Thanks to their ability to freely switch from a linear to a cycling form, C5 and C6 monosaccharides are reducing sugars. Pentoses and hexoses have the tendency to form cyclic or ring molecules “through a nucleophilic addition reaction between the carbonyl group and one of the hydroxyls of the same molecule. The reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging oxygen atom” (Wikipedia contributors 2018e). The most common rings are made of 5 or 6 atoms, respectively, with four C atoms and one O atom, and, five C atoms and one O atom (cyclic forms also referred to as furanose - Figure 4.7 - and pyranose - Figure 4.8 - , respectively, because they closely resemble furan, and pyran rings). Figure 4.7: Intramolecular cyclic hemiketal formation in fructose and more generally for furanose hexoses Figure 4.8: Intramolecular cyclic hemiacetal formation in glucose and more generally for pyranose hexoses Now, as the pentoses and hexoses form rings, the acetal functional group is formed (as previously detailed in section 3.3.5). For the aldohexoses to form rings, the aldehyde on carbon #1 (Figures 4.8) reacts with the hydroxyl of carbon #5 to form a 6 atom ring. And in can easily revert to the chain structure to have a free aldehyde again and be a reducing sugar. For fructose, a ketohexose, the ketone from carbon #2, reacts with the hydroxyl of also carbon #5, to now form a 5 atom ring (Figure 4.7). So why is this important enough to be mentioned here…? Figure 4.9: Structure of a generic acetal By NEUROtiker - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3508032 In the ring versions of the glucose and fructose, the carbons #1 and #2 now have single bonds with two oxygen atoms. This acetal group formed by a central carbon, and bonded in a tetrahedral as illustrated in Figure 4.9 is a rather special bond. In fact, special enough that it has some interesting consequences, with two different forms. If one of the atoms bound to oxygen is different than hydrogen (e.g., R’ and R&quot; in Figure 4.9 both not H), then this group is called an acetal group, and the bond is a rather stable bond. If one of the R’ or R&quot; in Figure 4.9 is H, while the other has some other radical, then the structure becomes asymmetric, the group formed is then called hemiacetal as is not nearly as stable. This explains why the hexoses may so easily switch from the linear chain to the cyclic configurations. These hemiacetal and hemiketal groups are one of the basis of the glycosidic bond, which binds the cyclic pentoses and hexoses in di- and polysaccharides, but also with other molecules. Figure 4.10: Cyclic structure or Haworth projection of alpha-D-glucopyranose (alpha-D-glucose; left) and beta-D-fructofuranose (beta-D-fructose; right) In Figure 4.10, both glucose and fructose are hexoses. But fructose generally forms furanose rings (5 atoms, including one oxygen atom), while glucose forms pyranose rings. The α and β correspond to whether the hydroxyl on the C#1 atom is below (α) or above (β) the plan made by the ring. Some more jargon here added for exactness of information only. Figure 4.11: Cyclic structure of beta-D-Ribofuranose (beta-D-ribose) and 2-deoxyribose Ribose and deoxyribose are the most important pentoses we need to know as they constitute one of the three ensembles or moeities that constitute nucleotides, i.e., the monomers of nucleic acids. They both exist either in furanose or pyranose forms, although the furanose form dominates, but the difference between ribose and deoxyribose is the missing oxygen atom on the C2’ atom (Figure 4.11). And yes, you guessed it right, this difference is the reason for the ‘R’ and ‘D’ in the RNA and DNA molecules. Notice that the carbon atoms are numbered in Figures 4.10 and 4.11. The numbers are ‘primed’ for the ribose and deoxyribose (Figure 4.11). This is a convention that geneticists have used to differentiate the carbons from the pentose to those of the base in nucleotides (see part on nucleic acids). This is anecdotal information again. So, what is there to remember about monosaccharides? In summary: Monosaccharides’ formula is (CH2O)n where 3 &lt; n &lt; 6 generally The C3 atom monosaccharide to remember is glyceraldehyde Small differences in the position of hydroxyl, and in the cyclization of the C5 and C6 make for different monosaccharides Each atom has on average 4 electrons for itself, making monosaccharides the ideal molecule to store and release energy electrons, although they have to be in the aldose chain form Thanks to all the hydroxyl groups, monosaccharides are extremely soluble in water. It is thanks to the rather unstable nature of the hemiketal and hemiacetal functional groups that the monosaccharides can easily switch configurations from linear chains where they can fulfill their role as electron donors, and cyclic rings where they act as structural monomers of di- and polysaccharides for the hexoses or as structural moeities for pentoses Glucose is arguably the most important monosaccharide and the only hexose molecule expected to be known by heart For glucose, and for organic chemistry in general, there are several ways of representing molecules. One of the ways is the Haworth projection as shown in Figures 4.10 and 4.11. Another way is called the Fischer projection as illustrated in Figures 4.4 and 4.5. Another way is called the skeletal formula where the carbons are implied at the corners and the ends of line segments, while oxygen and other remarkable radicals such as hydroxyl or amine are noted. Glucose is thus often represented as skeletal formula as in the left of Figure 4.12. Another even more simplified representation of glucose is represented in the ‘hyper’ skeletal formula. The latter has the advantage to be simple enough and used to illustrate polysaccharides. Figure 4.12: Skeletal formula for alpha-D-glucose (left) and ‘hyper’ skeletal formula (right) 4.2.2 Dissacharides Sucrose, lactose, and maltose are three common dissaccharides. Dissacharides are bioses or polymers of two hexose monomers. Because they are still small, and thanks to their solubility in water (thanks to hydroxyl groups), they play an essential role to transport energy in chemical forms because for a slight increase of the osmotic pressure in a liquid, dissaccharides carry twice the number of electrons. Dissaccharides correspond to the assemblage of two monosaccharides thanks to the glycosidic bond. The name of this bond suggests that it is very specific to carbohydrates, and it is true as one monosaccharide must be involved in a glycosidic bond. So the glycosidic bond is a type of covalent bond that joins a carbohydrate (sugar) molecule to another group, which may or may not be another carbohydrate. The common theme, however, is that the carbon of the sugar involved corresponds to that of the hemiacetal group. There are 4 types of glycosidic bonds, depending on the atom directly linked to the hemiacetal carbon of the carbohydrate: O-, N-, S-, or C-glycosidic bonds. Figure 4.13 illustrates the generic O- and N-glycosidic bond. Figure 4.13: Formation of glycosidic bonds between a hemiacetal Carbon and a hydroxyl or amine group, to respectively form O- and N-glycosidic bonds. The N-glycosidic bond occurs in nucleotides and thus plays a major role. But overall, the term glycosidic bond generally refers to the O-glycosidic bond between two consecutive monosaccharides (Figure 4.14). In the end, and to go back to the brick and mortar analogy, for di- and polysaccharides, the glycosidic bond is the equivalent of the mortar. Figure 4.14: Formation of glycosidic bonds between a glucose hemiacetal carbon and a methyl hydroxyde (top) or between two glucoses to form maltose Lactose and maltose (Figure 4.15) are dissaccharides, respectively assembled from a galactose and a glucose, and, from two glucose molecules. Notice that these two molecules are reducing sugars, i.e., there is one hemicetal carbon (C#1) free to potentially open one glucose into a chain form, hence the ability for both lactose and maltose to be readily available as electron donors. This is quite nice for lactose produced by mammal females to be readily available for their offsprings. On another note, during seed germination, starch (details below) is hydrolyzed into maltose first by the amylase enzyme, and then readily participate in energy generation for this critical time of seed plant lives. Figure 4.15: Lactose and maltose dissaccharides molecular formulae Interestingly, sucrose in not a reducing sugar as both hemiacetal carbons (C#1 of glucose, and C#2 of fructose) are part of the glycosidic bond (Figure 4.16). There are several advantages: Figure 4.16: Sucrose molecular formula Sucrose is a very stable molecule, and a lot more than lactose and maltose. Hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond is very slow and solutions of sucrose can last for a very long time. Because both hemiacetal carbons are bound, there are no more possibilities for an additional glycosidic bond to take place: sucrose stays as a dissaccharide This is actually essential for green vascular plants, which assemble sucrose in their leaves from glucose and fructose, but must transport these molecules away from the leaves to minimize weight and avoid jamming of the photosynthesis. So having a very stable, highly soluble, not polymerisable, non reducing molecule is very advantageous. Sucrose can then be hydrolyzed thanks to the sucrase enzyme into glucose and fructose again for use or storage at other places in the plants. So what is there to remember about dissaccharides? In summary: The glycosidic bond always involves one hemiacetal group and is the key for the formation of carbohydrate dimers, and also polymers Dissacharides are small molecules which are easily soluble thanks to the many hydroxyl groups and easily transportable For a very similar osmotic pressure, dissaccharides carry twice as many electrons as monosaccharides: dissaccharides are the ‘go to’ transport molecules Sucrose, a very stable molecule, non reducing sugar, is the molecule used by vascular plants to transport the products of photosynthesis (glucose and fructose) from the leaves to storage areas (both sometimes located very far apart - think about sequoias!) 4.2.3 Polyssaccharides or glycans Polysaccharides are polymers of monosaccharides linked together thanks to the glycosidic bond, forming sometimes very long chains (at least more than 10 monosaccharides, or else are referred to oligosaccharides), either linear or branched. The polysccharide chains are also referred to as glycans, the suffix an implying a chain of monosaccharides. In glycan, the prefix glyc refers to the generic carbohydrate. The term glucan refers to a chain of glucose monomers, similarly, the term xylan, refers to a chain of xylose monomers, and so on. Polysaccharides generally have two main functions: energy storage or structure. Because of the glycosidic bond, which removes a molecule of H2O, the general formula for a large polysaccharide is more like (C6H10O5)n often with 200 &lt; n &lt; 3500. For our purpose, it is important to remember that there are three main polysaccharides: homopolysaccharides or homoglycans, i.e., long chains of the same monomers (homo: same), and heteropolysaccharides or heteroglycans, long chains of a variety of monomers (hetero: different), generally separated into hemicelluloses and pectins. 4.2.3.1 Homopolysaccharides or homoglycans Among the most important homopolysaccharides, one can distinguish starch and glycogen, which are both energy storage molecules for plants, and animals, respectively, and, cellulose which has a structure function making a lot of the plants cell walls (Figure 4.17). Figure 4.17: Starch, glycogen, and cellulose are the three main homopolysaccharides of importance for our field. Obtained from https://www.sedelco.org/cms/lib/PA01001902/Centricity/Domain/506/05_Lecture_Presentation.pdf All three molecules are polymers of α- and β D-glucoses. Starch is a polymer of α-D-glucoses linked together by carbons 1 and 4. Glycogen has essentially the same structure, although it has some branches thanks to a bound between carbon 1 and 6 (Figure 4.18). Figure 4.18: Illustration of the 1-4 links between monomers of alpha-D-glucose for starch, plus 1-6 links to form branches for glycogen, and 1-4 links between monomers of beta-D-glucose for cellulose. Obtained from https://biochemikages005.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/carbohydrates/ Before we go on on describing the molecular structure of polysaccharides, it is time to reflect on their significance at the planet scale. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on earth (Klemm et al. 2005). Thanks to the hydrogen bonds between adjacent β-D-glucose polymers, very strong cellulose microfibrils form, themselves bundled into macrofibrils, surrounded by hemicelluloses and lignin (Figure 4.19). Cellulose molecules can be hydrolyzed thanks to the cellulase enzyme, generally secreted by bacteria, although animals such as termites do produce a cellulase. Most mammals only have a limited ability to digest cellulose fibers, and even ruminants and monogastric herbivores use symbiotic bacteria to produce cellulase. Figure 4.19: Illustration of Cellulose strands surrounded by hemicellulose and lignin in plant cell walls (Department of Energy’s Genomic, 1986). So if cellulose is the most abundant molecule on earth, one needs to pause in the structure description of polysaccharides and locate where polysaccharides play a role. Cellulose is the basic structure of plant cell walls. Plant cells, are distinctively different from animal cells because of their cell wall. It is the resemblance with honeycomb cells that Robert Hooke coined the term cell for plants in 1665, the shape being well defined and distinctive thanks to the walls. The cell wall is located externally to the plasma membrane and is synthesized by the cell itself. Morphologically, the cell wall is formed by layers or sheets. All cells have at least two: middle lamella and primary wall. The middle lamella is synthetized and shared by cells that are contiguous with each other, while the primary cell wall is synthetized and belongs to each cell. In some plant cells, a third thicker layer called secondary cell wall is deposited between the membrane and the primary wall. Most of the wood in the trees correspond to the secondary cell wall (Figure 4.20) (Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego 2013) Figure 4.20: Illustration of plant cell walls. In some cells, three layers can be distinguished in the secondary cell wall: S1, S2, and S3 layers are sometimes present, each with a different orientation of its fibers of cellulose. Obtained from the Atlas of Plant and Animal Histology (Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego 2013). The outermost layer of the cell wall and the first to form is the middle lamella. It acts as a glue that binds neighboring cells. The middle lamella consists mainly of pectins, although it can be lignified in those cells that have a secondary cell wall. The primary wall consists mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins, glycoproteins. For the cells that have one, the secondary wall consists mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignins (Figure 4.21; Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego 2013; Loix et al. 2017). Figure 4.21: Illustration of the glycans structure of plant cells with primary wall only (A), and plant cells with both primary and secondary walls (B) (Loix et al. 2017). Of these different classes, only cellulose is well defined, consisting entirely of β-(1→4)-linked glucan chains. Pectin are highly heterogeneous polysaccharides, traditionally characterized by being relatively easily extracted with hot acid or chelators and by containing a large amount of galacturonic acid residues. Hemicelluloses traditionally comprise the remaining polysaccharides […] (Scheller and Ulvskov (2010)) 4.2.3.2 Pectins Pectins are heteroglycans based on galacturonans, or polygalaturonic acids, i.e. polymers of galacturonic acid monomers. For comparison purposes, the difference between glucose and galacturonic acid are illustrated in Figure 4.22 below. The alcohol functional group of glucose on C6 is oxidized into a carboxylic acid group, and the hydroxyl on C4 changes side. The main role of pectin is to give physical strength to the plant and to provide a barrier against the outside environment (Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller 2010). Pectins also hold cells together. Fruit ripening (becoming softer) or leaf fall, are in part due to the decomposition of pectins by pectinase enzymes. Pectins also seem to play a role during seed germination, and as such also have an energy storage role, particularly thanks to the galactans and arabinans (Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller 2010; Scheller and Ulvskov 2010) Figure 4.22: Illustration of the differences between alpha-D-glucose and D-galacturonic acid monomers. Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller (2010) classify pectins in four categories (Figure 4.23): the homogalacturonans (HG), which are relatively homogeneous galacturonans, although some acetyl (-CH2-CH3) or methyl (-CH3, more details herein) groups can be added. These are the most abundant, ~65% (Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller 2010) the xylogalacturonans (XGA), for which some xylose monomers are added to the the galacturonan chain thanks to the glycosidic bonds. XGA appear to be minor components of pectins. the Rhamnogalacturonans II (RGII), which still hold the galacturonan as the basic chain, but with complicated carbohydrate chains, containing rhamnose monomers in particular. RGII appear to be minor components of pectins. and the Rhamnogalacturonans I (RGI), for which rhamnose monomers alternate between galacturonic acids and that side carbohydrate side chains of arabinans and galactans. RGI constitute between 20-35% of the pectins. Figure 4.23: Illustration of the general types of pectins. Notice that the common structure or pectin backbone (but for RGI) is the polymer of galacturonic acids, or galacturonan, to which, quite a diversity of monomers participate resulting in the large heterogeneity of these heteroglycans (Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller 2010). Again, this information is provided to expose readers to the extraordinary diversity of carbohydrates, and are not meant to be known in great details. It is important to remember that in addition to homoglycans, there are galactorunans, on which pectins are bases. 4.2.3.3 Hemicelluloses Hemicelluloses are heteroglycans or heteropolysaccharides. The hemicellulose term was coined at a time when the structures were not well understood and biosynthesis was completely unknown. Hemicellulose is recognized as a group of wall polysaccharides that are characterized by being neither cellulose nor pectin and by having β-(1→4)- linked backbones of glucose, mannose, or xylose (Figure 4.24). These glycans all have the same equatorial configuration at C1 and C4 and hence the backbones have significant structural similarity (Scheller and Ulvskov 2010). For those of you who are curious about the ‘equatorial configuration’ term used here, this has to do with the steric configuration of the hydroxyl groups in the cyclic configuration of monosaccharides. This was not even introduced in this chapter, although it is an important consideration for chemists to characterize carbohydrates! Figure 4.24: Illustration of the general types of hemicelluloses, which vary among species and plant groups. Notice the nomenclatures ending in -an, suggesting polysaccharides. OMe, represents methyl groups; Ac, represents acetyl groups; “Fer” represents esterification with ferulic acid (3-methoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) (after Scheller and Ulvskov 2010). The most important biological role of hemicelluloses is their contribution to strengthening the cell wall by interaction with cellulose microfibrilsand, in some walls, with lignin (e.g., Figure 4.20). All the hemicelluloses show differences in structural details between different species and in different cell types within plants (Figure 4.24). 4.2.3.4 Lignins Lignin (from the latin lignum, meaning wood) is, after cellulose, the second most abundant terrestrial biopolymer, accounting for approximately 30% of the organic carbon in the biosphere. The ability to synthesize lignin has been essential in the evolutionary adaptation of plants from an aquatic environment to land. Lignin is crucial for structural integrity of the cell wall and stiffness and strength of the stem. In addition, lignin waterproofs the cell wall, enabling transport of water and solutes through the vascular system, and plays a role in protecting plants against pathogens (Boerjan, Ralph, and Baucher 2003). It is thought that it is the multiple aromatic rings of the phenylpropanoids that provide the stiffness of lignin, hence of wood. Figure 4.25: Three common monolignols, monomers for the lignin molecules: paracoumaryl alcohol (1), coniferyl alcohol (2) and sinapyl alcohol (3) By Yikrazuul - Own work, Public Domain Lignins are polymers of a lot more complex monomers than the monosaccharides presented earlier. The monomers of lignin are called monolignols. Nothing to be scared of, because there is no expectation for the reader to know them! Technically, the lignin monomers are generally referred to as phenylpropanoids (which means that there is a phenol radical attached to a propane like C3 structure). The suffix -oid means pseudo), and technically derived from hydroxycinnamyl alcohol differing in their degree of methoxylation, p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols (Figure 4.25). Figure 4.26: Illustration of the diversity of monomers and polymer units present in lignins (Boerjan, Ralph, and Baucher 2003) When introduced in the lignin polymer the corresponding monolignols are named guaiacyl (G), sinapyl (S), and hydroxyl-coumaroyl (H) units, respectively (Figure 4.26). The G, S, and H abbreviation letters are often used in the lignin literature. For example, the composition of lignin varies between plant species and tissues. In general, lignins from gymnosperms and related species (called softwood in English) are rich in G units and contains low amounts of H units, whereas lignins of angiosperm dicotyledons (flowing plants with reticulate or network-like leaf veins) are mainly composed of G and S units (corresponding to hardwood in English). For references only and to have some awareness of the diversity of the monomers and polymer units, Figure 4.26 has been added above. An example of a possible lignin structure is illustrated in Figure 4.27. It shows the great complexity of this second most important molecule on earth after cellulose. Figure 4.27: An example of a possible lignin structure. The portion shown here has 28 monomers (mostly coniferyl alcohol), 278 carbon atoms, 407 hydrogen atoms, and 94 oxygen atoms. Karol Głąbpl.wiki On an interesting note, it has recently been shown that polymerization of the monolignols is not random, but that monolignols are first assembled into lignol dimers (two monolignols), referred to as lignans. Lignans are thus dehydrodimers of monolignols (Davin et al. 1997; reviewed in Wang et al. 2013). There seems to be a plethora of lignans in nature, but exploring the literature on these reveals that some lignans, after ingestion by mamals may have anti-cancer properties! For the record and in case you are fascinated by how things are connected, some of the names and structures of these lignans are rather indicative of where they have been found or associated. For example in Figure 4.28, you can see that one of them is called pinoresinol, suggesting links with pine and resin. Another one is called lariciresinol. Larix is the genus name of the larches tree in English. Another one secoisolariciresinol, the prefix secoi-, likely having to do with sequoia, and so on. Podophyllotoxin at the left bottom is found in the toxic American mandrake, or ground lemon plant, but also on some flax seeds, and seems to be an interesting anti-oxidant for colon cancer (Fuss 2003). Figure 4.28: Hypothetical biosynthetic pathway leading from coniferylalcohol to podophyllotoxin showing a variety of lignans or lignol dimers used in the biosynthesis of lignin, but also having antioxidant properties beneficial for the health of mammals (Fuss 2003) 4.2.4 Other important carbohydrates It would be erroneous to leave out some additional mono- or polyssaccharrides out as some of them play a very significant role in biology and ecology. In a way, they correspond to the exceptions that confirm or rather complete the rule. So far, we have summarized monosaccharides with the general formula (CH2O)n, to essentially be mostly C5 and C6 molecule where the average carbon is bonded to an hydroxyl functional group and a hydrogen atom. And that these monosaccharides have the tendency to form 5 or 6 atom rings. Well, it turns out that on this general configuration, some of the hydroxyl groups are replaced by other functional groups. The most famous one is probably is deoxybose, as it replaces ribose, as already mentioned above and illustrated again below (Figure 4.29). Figure 4.29: Replacement of a hydroxyl group of ribose by hydrogen, effectively removing an oxygen atom or ‘deoxy-ing’ the ribose, hence the formation of deoxyribose Several others that need mentioning are illustrated below. The first one is glucosamine where carbon number 2 has been replaced by an amine group. Glucosamine is a precursor of glycosylated proteins and lipids (glycosylated means that a sugar is linked with a protein/lipid other substituent via a glycosidic bond). When an acetyl group is added to the amine group of a glucosamine (via an amide bond), the resulting carbohydrate is called N-acetylglucosamine (Figure 4.30). Figure 4.30: Important additional monosaccharides where the hydroxyl group has been replaced by an amine and an N-acetylamine Two of these bonded via a glycosic bond form the monomer for chitin (Figure 4.31), i.e., the polysaccharide forming the exoskeleton of arthropods, such as crustaceans and insects, the radulae of molluscs, cephalopod beaks, and the scales of fish and lissamphibians [Wikipedia contributors (2019e); Figure 4.32]. Figure 4.31: N-acetylamine dimer forming the basis for the chitin polysaccharide that serves as exoskeleton of many invertebrates The exoskeleton of these macroinvetebrates possesses excellent mechanical properties in terms of stiffness-todensity ratio and fracture toughness (Nikolov et al. 2011). This is explained by the microstructure of the exoskeleton, and how the chitin nanofibrils are put together (Figure 4.32). Figure 4.32: Exoskeleton of the American lobster (Homarus americanus) formed by seven levels of microstrucutures of the nanofibrils of chitin, polysaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine (Nikolov et al. 2011) Deoxygenation of the alcohol group of carbon 6 of glucose yields quinovose or 6-deoxyglucose (Figure 4.33). The methyl radical can become sulfanated by a sulfo- radical, to yield sulfoquinovose. Sulfoquinovose is one of the backbone sugars for glycolipids that form the innermembrane of thylakoids in chloroplasts (more details in section 4.5.5.3). The molecule quinovose is a sugar moiety of the quinovin molecule, extracted from the bark of the tree of the cinchena genus in South America. The local Quechuan name is kina, and the new kina, is a quina nova, hence the word quinovin by contraction. And the sugar or ose of the quinovin is thus named a quinovose. Figure 4.33: Glucose, quinovose, and sulfoquinovose as important monosaccharides used as building blocks for glycolipids forming the inner membranes of thylakoids in chloroplasts Lastly, carbohydrates play a major role in the communication between cells as carbohydrates small chains are often attached to membrane proteins and lipids, in which case proteins and lipids are referred to as glycoproteins and glycolipids, respectively (more details below). Learning outcomes at the end of this section on carbohydrates, you should be able to: Monosaccharides: Their formula is (CH2O)n where 3 &lt; n &lt; 6 generally The C3 atom monosaccharide to remember is glyceraldehyde Small differences in the position of hydroxyl, and in the cyclisation of the C5 and C6 make for different monosaccharides Each atom has on average 4 electrons for itself, making monosaccharides the ideal molecule to store and release energy electrons, although they have to be in the aldose chain form Thanks to all the hydroxyl groups, monosaccharides are extremely soluble in water. Glucose is arguably the most important monosaccharide and the only hexose molecule you are expected to know how to draw by heart 4.3 Proteins The second molecular family we choose to present is proteins. Etymology Corner The word proteins used in English results from the French word protéine first coined by Dutch organic and analytical chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder in an article published in 1838 (Mulder 1838), and later translated in German as Protein in 1839. Both words are based on the ancient greek πρωτειοζ or proteioz (~primary), because Mulder thought that the ‘organic acids making protéines appeared to be the primitive or principal substance that plants prepare for herbivores, which the latter provide to the carnivores’ (Mulder 1838; Hartley 1951). Proteins correspond to single, or assemblages of, polymers of amino acids referred to as polypeptide chains. This chapter is still under construction 4.4 Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids The third molecular family we choose to present are Nucleic Acids. https://www.britannica.com/science/acid Nucleotide, any member of a class of organic compounds in which the molecular structure comprises a nitrogen-containing unit (base) linked to a sugar and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are of great importance to living organisms, as they are the building blocks of nucleic acids, the substances that control all hereditary characteristics. In the two families of nucleic acids, ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA or RNA codes for the structure of proteins synthesized in the cell. The nucleotide adenosine triphosphate (ATP) supplies the driving force of many metabolic processes. Several nucleotides are coenzymes; they act with enzymes to speed up (catalyze) biochemical reactions. The nitrogen-containing bases of nearly all nucleotides are derivatives of three heterocyclic compounds: pyrimidine, purine, and pyridine. The most common nitrogen bases are the pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, and uracil), the purines (adenine and guanine), and the pyridine nicotinamide. Nucleosides are similar to nucleotides except that they lack the phosphate group. Nucleosides themselves rarely participate in cell metabolism. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is one of the components of RNA and also the organic component of the energy-carrying molecule ATP. In certain vital metabolic processes, AMP combines with inorganic phosphate to form ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and then ATP. The breaking of the phosphate bonds in ATP releases great amounts of energy that are consumed in driving chemical reactions or contracting muscle fibres. Cyclic AMP, another nucleotide, is involved in regulating many aspects of cellular metabolism, such as the breakdown of glycogen. A dinucleotide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), participates in many oxidation reactions as an electron carrier, along with the related compound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). These substances act as cofactors to certain enzymes. We have not mentioned this molecule just yet because it is a complicated molecule. Yet, it plays a crucial role in many catalytic reactions Structure of coenzyme A: 1: 3′-phosphoadenosine. 2: diphosphate, organophosphate anhydride. 3: pantoic acid. 4: β-alanine. 5: cysteamine.

This is the best concise and satisfying definition! The scientific term “lipid” comes from the Greek “lipos” which referred to animal fat or vegetable oil. Lipids are mainly made of C and H atoms, but do also contain O, N, and P. So it is important to remember that lipids are made of CHONP. Lipids are a very heterogeneous group of molecules and are defined in part from their propensity to be soluble in non-polar solvents (no net dipole as a result of the opposing charges in the solvent molecules). In other words, lipids do not (or not easily) dissolve in water. Contrary to carbohydrates, proteins, or nucleic acids, lipids are not obvious polymers of identified and clearly defined monomers. Rather, lipids are assemblages of well identified building blocks and backbones bonded together with ester, ether, and amide bonds. There are two main types of building blocks resulting in two major types of lipids: lipids built from fatty acid blocks (acyl groups) and lipids based from isoprene building units (ringed or not isoprene groups). Because there is no polymerization, lipids are relatively small molecules compared to polysaccharides, proteins, or nucleic acids. Figure 4.34: Common everyday ingredients containing lipids. (obtained from http://blesslaboratory.com/index.php/services/oil The carbons of lipids are generally a lot more reduced (have more electrons for themselves) than the ones of carbohydrates. For the latter, there are just about as many oxygen atoms as there are carbons, as a legacy of how they are formed during photosynthesis (details in chapter 6). Because of the number of oxygen atoms and their reactivity, carbohydrates are only able to form relatively short 5 and 6 carbon monomers, which tend to readily assemble into rings. Polymerization is what allows carbohydrates to form very large molecules. Lipids aliphatic chains have almost no oxygen atoms instead, and always strategically located near the ends of the chains. Consequently, the carbons of the hydrocarbon chains are not as prompt to react together. The result is that it becomes possible to have longer hydrocarbon molecules (commonly C16 to C22, compared to C5 and C6 carbohydrates). The aliphatic chains are relatively chemically inert and interact together by low level van der Waals forces. These long aliphatic chains are the reasons for the mostly hydrophobic character of lipids (Figure 4.34). However, the fatty acid-based lipids are amphipathic (also referred to as amphiphilic), i.e., that they have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends. The hydrophobic end or hydrophobic tail corresponds to the long aliphatic chain of the fatty acid residue. The hydrophilic end or hydrophilic head is associated with the other building blocks made of ionic and polar groups that include ester and amide bonds, the backbone, and other polar radicals (details below). The amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles, multilamellar/unilamellar liposomes, or membranes in an aqueous environment (Wikipedia contributors 2019a). Overall, lipids function as essential structural components of membranes, as signalling molecules, as chemical identifiers of specific membranes and as energy storage molecules (Meer, Voelker, and Feigenson 2008). Thousands of lipid molecules have been listed and an entire scientific discipline called lipidomics is dedicated to lipids structure and function! Rigorous classifications have been proposed (e.g., Fahy et al. (2005), Fahy et al. (2009)), and gateways on lipid research and updates are available (e.g., lipidmaps). Our goal here is to present enough of what lipids are and do. Overall lipids may be divided into eight categories: fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides (derived from condensation of acyl subunits); and sterol lipids and prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits) (Wikipedia contributors 2019a) 4.5.1 Overview of fatty acid- or acyl-based lipids In this category, are included fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, saccharolipids, and sphingolipids. They all have in common the presence of long aliphatic carbon chains forming ‘tails’ of the molecules. The average carbon of a fatty acid chain is a methylene (-CH2-) such that each carbon atom has 6 electrons for itself (Figure 4.35). Consequently, lipids are, among the macromolecules, those which can store and release the most energy per carbon atom! Figure 4.35: Electron allocation of a generic fatty acyl group (CH2)n. The group -CH2- is referred to as a methelene group Lipids share with nucleic acids the ‘building block’ structure, in that they are built of identified building blocks. The quintessential acyl-based lipid is made of two fatty acids forming the hydrophobic tail end, a backbone, a phosphate or hexose, and a polar group. The two latter building blocks form the hydrophilic head, which tends to be a lot shorter than the hydrophobic end as illustrated in Figure 4.36 below. Figure 4.36: Schematic of the quintessential fatty acid based lipid illustrating the amphipathic nature, and the different building blocks From this simple construction, thousands of acyl-based lipid molecules exist following a wide variation on the fatty acids themselves, the three types of backbones, and on the polar groups (nature and number). And there are lots of exception to this general rule (e.g., Fahy et al. 2005, 2009). Nonetheless, Figure 4.37 summarizes how acyl-based lipids are constructed and how some of the classification has been derived. It reads from the bottom to top. The first stage of molecules having only one of the building blocks are the fatty acids. There are so many of them that they are classified as a lipid group by themselves. Figure 4.37: The main types of fatty acid based lipids: illustrating the common fatty acid base, and resulting from the three types of backbones and a variety of polar groups making the hydrophilic head) The second stage molecules are lipids built from fatty acids + a backbone. The backbone molecules can bind with one to three fatty acids on one side, with ester (most often), ether, or amide bonds, and with other radicals on the other side allowing more building blocks to be added. There are three main backbone molecules: glycerol, hexosamine (glucosamine in Figure 4.37), and sphingosine. Mono-, di- and triacylglycerols (previously called mono-, di-, and triglycerides, respectively) play such an important role in metabolism and energy storage, that the glycerolipids have been identified as a group of its own. Glycerolipids with additional building blocks eventually lead to the glycerophospholipid family (green in Figure 4.37). The glucosamine (hexose with an amine group) eventually leads to the saccharolipid family (blue in Figure 4.37). Sphingosine plays both the role of a backbone and of a fatty acid thanks to its long saturated aliphatic tail. Sphingosine-based lipids eventually lead to the sphingolipid family (grey in Figure 4.37). The third stage are lipid molecules built from fatty acids + a backbone + phosphate or a sugar. It is quite interesting to realize that only two molecules, phosphate or an hexose, play that role. They have enough hydroxyl functional group to make ester bonds with other groups. Most glycerophospholipids have a fourth stage of building blocks, and the third stage is thus an intermediate form. Many glycolipids and sphingolipids, however, only have stage three molecules and are incorporated into cell membranes as such. The fourth stage are lipid molecules with four building blocks: fatty acids + a backbone + phosphate or a sugar + polar group. These molecules make about 50% of the cell membranes and thus play a major role in life. It is the amphipathic nature of these molecules that leads them to readily assemble into acyl lipid bilayers (generally referred to as phospholipids). The hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads tend to aggregate together forming a layer or sheet of molecules a bit like a bundle of wheat that would have the stems together and the wheat ears together. Because cells essentially are aqueous systems, the hydrophobic side of the layer is naturally unstable, unless it is stabilized by another layer of phospholipids, with the hydrophobic tails facing each other and the hydrophilic heads facing the aqueous phase of the cell (more details later). Third and fourth stage acyl-based lipids all have similar features: they have a hydrophobic tail group, and a hydrophyllic head group. As a result, they tend to naturally congregate together to form the famous lipid bilayer in which proteins and glycoproteins, serving as cell receptors, catalyzers, or exchange regulators can readily embed. In summary: Lipids, unlike other molecular families, are not polymers of monomers but are built from building blocks Fatty acid long (C16-C22) saturated or unsaturated chains are the basis of what lipids are, sterols being an exception Because there are very few oxygen atoms, carbon atoms have more electrons for themselves and lipids thus serve as energy storage for the cell and organisms Most membrane lipids are made of two fatty acids forming a hydrophobic tail, linked to a hydrophilic head, thanks to a backbone intermediate molecule It is the amphipathic nature of lipids that allow the formation of a bilayer membrane which create cell compartments and in which proteins can be inserted Time to pause in the strict biochemical description of acyl-based lipids, and spend some time to introduce an overview of the function of these lipids in cell membranes. This should make the description of these be more fascinating later on. 4.5.2 Lipids as key to cell membrane structure and function In this section, lots of concepts are thrown at the reader, whom might be a bit rebuted by so many apparently complicated names (although most of them already appear in Figure 4.37). I decided to present the membrane function first in hope of making the biochemical description of enough of the lipids more interesting. So no worries, read this as a fascinating introduction to the wonders of life, and of lipids! The first important concept to grasp is that in the lipid bilayer, the adjacent lipid molecules are not bonded together. It is thanks to their hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, and to a lesser degree thanks to electrostatic interactions, that the membrane lipids stay together and that cellular membranes exist altogether. The membrane does not have a solid crystalline nature, but rather a more fluidic nature, where molecules can freely move about within their layer or sheet. Proteins can insert themselves into this bilayer system thanks to the fluidic behavior. They too must have some amphipathic properties as well with hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends. Because proteins are inserted in a mosaic pattern, the fluidic mosaic model proposed in 1972 [Singer and Nicolson (1972); Figure 4.38] was the first accepted model to describe membrane bilayer. Figure 4.38: The fluidic mosaic model as published by Singer and Nicholson (1972). The filled circles represent the ionic and polar head groups of the phospholipid molecules, which make contact with water; the wavy lines represent the fatty acid chains which make contact which each other. The membrane is made of two layers or leaflet of lipids mirroring each other and touching each other from the fatty acid side. The integral proteins are shown as globular molecules partially embedded in, and partially protruding from, the membrane The second important concept is that the diversity of membrane lipids and their layout and interactions together allow the concurrent formation of fluidic and more rigid areas in the membrane itself corresponding to different phases. The two main phases are the liquid-disordered phase, very fluidic, almost liquid-like, and the liquid-ordered phase, more gel-like and more rigid. The liquid disordered phase is a highly fluid state in which individual lipids can move laterally across the surface of the membrane relatively unhindered. Liquid-disordered bilayers are often characterized by irregular packing of individual lipid molecules, as well as the presence of kinks in unsaturated fatty acids. These kinks effectively reduce the surface area accessible to other fatty acid chains, weakening van der Waals interactions (Membrane Phase Transitions, libretext). When the fatty acid chains are more fully extended because they are more saturated, and/or because they interact with sterols (details below), they become more fully packed and the van der Waals interactions are increased. They yields to a more rigid gel-like structure referred to as the liquid ordered phase. And guess what, this is where the proteins are also located and this makes sense because they have a more rigid structure in which to stay (Figure 4.39). Figure 4.39: Membranes show a lipidic bilayer structure with lateral heterogeneity. Some lipids associate to form more dense areas known as membrane nanodomains or lipid rafts. In these domains, some proteins are included more frequently by electrochemical affinity. Cholesterol is located among the fatty acid chains, close to hydrophilic heads of the lipids, straighten fatty acids, and provide more rigidity to the membrane. Transmembrane proteins allow communication between extracellular and intracellular environments. Carbohydrates are found in the outer monolayer of the cell membrane forming the so-called glycocalyx. In this figure, the interactions of cell membrane molecules with cytoskeleton and with extracellular matrix are not depicted [Figure and caption after Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego (2013) and Artur Jan Fijałkowski In other words, the number of unsaturated bonds in the fatty acid chains have a major impact on how fluidic the membrane is. The more unsaturated, the more kinks, and the more fluidic the membrane. Reversely, the more saturated, the less kinks, the more packed the hydrophobic tails, and the less fluidic the membrane. The addition of sterol lipids tends to generate the more rigid liquid ordered phase (Figure 4.40), and these tend to be present where the proteins are embedded in the membrane (Figure 4.39 and 4.41). Figure 4.40: Liquid-order and liquid-disorder phases in membranes due to the level of saturation of fatty acids and interactions with cholesterol and transmembrane interactions. AP- anchored protein (after Harayama and Riezman (2018)) The aggregations of lipids around proteins are referred to as membrane rafts (or lipid rafts) or membrane nanodomains (Simons and Ikonen 1997; Edidin 2003) (Figure 4.39 and 4.41). And the lipids that give the liquid-ordered gel-like phase around proteins tend to include sphingolipids and cholesterols (Simons and Ikonen 1997; Ahmed, Brown, and London 1997; Hooper 1999; Varma and Mayor 1998; Edidin 2003; Toulmay and Prinz 2013; Schmidt and Davis 2017; Sezgin et al. 2017; Harayama and Riezman 2018), phosphatidylserine and cholesterol, and phosphatidylinositol, which, thanks to their long aliphatic chains, tend to interact from one leaflet of the membrane to the other (Figure 4.40). An entire symposium on membrane raft generated this definition which highlights the importance of special lipids and their interactions with cholesterol: Membrane rafts are small (10–200 nm), heterogeneous, highly dynamic, sterol- and sphingolipid-enriched domains that compartmentalize cellular processes. Small rafts can sometimes be stabilized to form larger platforms through protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions (Pike 2006). Figure 4.41: a | Lipid raft domains are usually defined as small, highly dynamic and transient plasma membrane entities that are enriched in saturated phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycolipids, cholesterol, lipidated proteins and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. Enrichment of these hydrophobic components endows these lipid domains with distinct physical properties; these include increased lipid packing and order, and decreased fluidity. In addition to membrane components, cortical actin plays an active part in domain maintenance and remodelling. Furthermore, membrane lipids are asymmetrically distributed in the inner and outer leaflets, which may further affect membrane organization. b | It is likely that membrane organization is not binary (that is, highly distinct raft and non-raft regions), but instead membranes consist of various raft-like and non-raft domains with distinct compositions and properties. (Figure and caption from Sezgin et al. 2017) Cholesterol, a name that has been used quite a bit until now although not defined, yet, seems to play a major role in membrane rigidity around the membrane nanodomains. It seems that the amide of the sphingolipid backbone can both donate and accept a hydrogen bond, and these hydrogen bonds are within the interfacial region of the membrane, in which the relative paucity of water increases the stability of these bonds (Sezgin et al. (2017); Figure 4.42). Figure 4.42: Cholesterol can create hydrogen bond inside the water free membrane which provides additional rigidity to the membrane in lipid rafts (Figure after Sezgin et al. 2017) The third important concept is that in addition to lateral heterogeneity around membrane nanodomains, the membrane lipids assemblage dictates the curvature of the membrane and the assemblage is asymetric between the inner and outer leaflets of the membrane (reviewed by Harayama and Riezman (2018); Figure 4.43). The very nature of the membrane lipids leads to a cylindrical shape, a conical shape, or inverted-conical shapes. When assembled together, these shapes allow for membrane curvature and fission (Figure 4.43). Additionally, some membrane lipids such as PhosphatidylSerine (PS), because of the serine (an amino acid) group as the polar group, tends to bind with cytoplasm proteins like actin (considered to be the cytoskeleton, or the skeleton that keeps animal cells together). As a result, PS tends to be on the inner leaflet of the membrane. Figure 4.43: The shape of the different membrane acyl-based lipids leads to curvature of a membrane leafet, and the overall bilayer membrane results in part from the asymetric layout of the membrane lipids. SM - SphingoMyelin, PC - PhosphatidylCholine, CHOL - Cholesterol, PS - PhosphatidylSerine, PE - PhosphatidylEthanolamine, PE-O - PhosphatidylEthanolamine with ether bonds (after Harayama and Riezman (2018) and Skotland and Sandvig (2019)) The fourth and last important concept is that animal, plant, algal, or bacterial membranes do not have the same membrane lipids. Membrane lipids within an organism may differ from one organelle to the next. For example, the membranes of the thyllakoids, the organelle responsible for photosynthesis, are built with specialized galactolipids. Saccharolipids are found in bacteria only. It was impossible to leave this section about membranes without providing what is considered a realistic representation of what a membrane might look like in reality. In other words, things are a lot more complex than our brain can fully handle! Figure 4.44: Glimpse at the near future: model of the plasma membrane in full complexity. Featuring: a lipid bilayer composed of hundreds of different lipids, crowded with a large variety of embedded as well as peripherally bound proteins, a supporting actin skeleton, a cytoplasmic site full of proteins, and realistic gradients of metabolites, ions, and pH (Figure and caption from Marrink et al. 2019) In summary: It is the amphipathic nature of membrane lipids that allows the formation of a bilayer of acyl-based lipids with the hydrophilic heads facing outwards and the hydrophobic tails facing inward Because acyl-based lipid molecules in each layer are not bonded together, the lipid molecules can move freely within the sheet Proteins are associated with membrane nanodomains where the membrane lipids have a liquid-order or gel-like phase and the membrane is more rigid. The membrane nanodomains or lipid rafts are largely enriched in membrane lipids that have straight saturated hydrophobic tails and are enriched with cholesterol It is the straight saturated hydrophobic tails of saturated acyls that shorten distances between molecules and increase van der Waals interactions, resulting in a more rigid structure. Hydrogen-binding between cholesterol and aliphatic tails add to membrane rigidity in these lipid rafts It is the unsaturated bonds in the hydrophobic tail that create kinks in most other membrane lipids, effectively maintaining larger distance between molecules, and weakening the van der Waals interactions, which in the end maintain a liquid-disordered of liquid-like phase of the membrane outside the membrane nanodomains The cylindrical or conical shape of the membrane lipids and their lateral placement dictate the curvature and shape of the membrane The presence and nature of proteins on the inner or outer side of the membrane is associated with the assymetry of the assemblages of lipids at the inner and outer leaflets of the membrane Membrane lipids composition may vary from an organism to another or with organelles within cells Now that the overview of the functions of membrane lipids is in the reader’s mind, time to enjoy some more detailed biochemistry of lipids! 4.5.3 Fatty acids: lipids of their own and primary common building blocks 4.5.3.1 Saturated and unsaturated fatty-acid chains So what are fatty acids afterall? Fatty acid are carboxylic acids with a long aliphatic chain (synonymous to long hydrocarbon chain or alkyl chain), which are either saturated (e.g., palmitic acid in Figure 4.45), mono-, or poly-unsaturated (i.e., there are at least one double bond between two consecutive carbon atoms, as illustrated in Figure 4.45; more details in section 3.1.2). The double bond in the aliphatic chain is rigid and can create ‘kinks’ in the 3D shape and their number and locations are key to their final 3D shape. Most fatty acids in nature have even number of carbons and range from 10 to 22 carbon atoms. Most present in membrane lipids have between 16 and 22 carbon atoms. Figure 4.45: Examples of saturated fatty acids (palmitic and stearic acids), mono-unsaturated oleic acid, and poly-unsaturated fatty acids exhibiting ‘kinks’, which when part of a membrane lipids, participate in the fluidic nature of the membrane. Sphingosine technically is not a fatty acid but is illustrated to show that it is straight like a saturated fatty acid. In XX:Y, XX corresponds to the number of carbon atoms, and Y corresponds to the number of unsaturated bonds. ω-3 means that the last unsaturated bond is at 3 carbons from the end (red font). The blue numbers correspond to the carbon number from the carboxyl end. EPA and DHA are abbreviations for these fatty acids. Further explanation in the text below Fatty acids have been classified according to their carbon-chain length and their level of saturation. According to their length, Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) have aliphatic chains with less than 6 carbon atoms. Even acetic acid (CH2COOH, acid of the vinegar) is classified in this category; so is butyric acid (C4) present in butter. Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6 to 12 carbons, which can form medium-chain triglycerides. Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 13 to 21 carbons. These are the typical molecules to which the generic term is often associated. Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are fatty acids with 22 or more carbons. VLCFA can represent up to a few percent of the total fatty acid content of a cell. Fatty acids are then classified depending on whether they are saturated, mono- or polysaturated, but also whether there are some methyl, cyclic, hydroxyl, or nitro radicals in their chains, to name a few. This is way beyond the purpose of this book but many details can be found on the LipidWeb maintained by Dr. Christie or classified by Fahy (2005, 2009). In addition to being precursors of other lipids, fatty acids have their own metabolic role. For humans, many fatty acids play essential roles in, e.g., brain activities, cellular messengers, or have been identified to have health benefits. Two fatty acids are considered essential fatty acids for humans, i.e., that humans need them but lack the ability to synthesize them (Figure 4.46). Figure 4.46: α-linolenic acid (omega-3 acid) and linoleic acids (omega-6 fatty acid) are the two essential polyunsaturated fatty acids humans must ingest for their metabolic needs 4.5.3.2 The famous omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids The Alpha Linoleic Acid (ALA) is an omega-3 fatty acid. This very common everyday life denomination gives the opportunity to introduce some nomenclature and fascinating facets of fatty acids. As stated before, in organic chemistry in general, each carbon is given a number, carbon number 1 starting with the most important functional group. As a result, in fatty acids, the carbon of the carboxyl group is given the value “1” (blue numbers in Figures 4.45 and 4.46). In unsaturated fatty acids, the number and location of the double bond(s) are very important because, again, it influences the 3D shape of the aliphatic chains (Figure 4.45) and is reflected in the naming. So the first approach to name fatty acid is to follow organic chemistry rules. For example, linoleic acid is a 18 carbon molecule and has two unsaturated bonds. The corresponding alkane is an octadecane, octadec- prefix meaning 18. But it also is a carboxylic acid, so the suffix will be -oic. It has two unsaturated bonds, so it is a diene, di- for 2, and -ene for alkene. The placement of the unsaturated bonds are on the 9th and 12th carbon. So its name is a 9,12-octadecdienoic acid or octadec-9,12-dienoic acid!! OK, but this does not really explain the omega part. In molecules of 16 to 22 carbons, it became obvious to chemists that it was just as easy to count from the other end or methyl end (fewer carbons to count!) to locate the double bonds. So they started to also report counting from the methyl end. Since “the alpha and the omega” is a known biblical expression meaning “the beginning and the end”, the “alpha” of the fatty acid became the beginning of the aliphatic chain (i.e., carbon number 2, see α linolenic acid in Figure 4.46), and the “omega” became the end carbon of the aliphatic chain. The expression “omega-3” really means “omega minus 3”, or that the last unsaturated bond is located at three carbons from the end. But what about the other double bond(s)? How does one know where it is (they are) located? Well, it turns out that for most polyunsaturated fatty acids, the double bonds are located every 3 carbons! Such that the carbons on each side of the double bonds are in the cis configuration, or that they ‘face’ each other rather than being on the oposite side of the double bond (in which case they would be in a trans configuration, further description in section 3.1.2). So lipid chemists have come up with much simplified nomenclature and the linoleic acid would then be referred to as a 18:2(n-3). This means that the fatty acid has 18 carbons, has 2 unsaturated bonds, the last one is the third carbon from the end (n-3, n replaces ω in most modern naming). And because there are no further precisions, all the double bonds are in a cis configuration and therefore the other double bond is at an (n-6) location. Voilà! The omega-3 fatty acids are a gateway to health sciences and medicine! Briefly, the two essential fatty acids cited above serve as precursor to other very important fatty acids. The first notable one is the arachidonic acid (20:4(n-6)). The name arachidonic acid suggests that this acid is particularly present in peanut oil. You should now be able to write its formula before you check it out and verify it from Figure 4.45! Arachidonic acid is the preponderant fatty acid included in the membrane phospholipids. It is also the presursor of very important C20 and C22 fatty acids, building blocks of membrane phospholipids of the brain. In fact, there is high probability that you might have heard about the EPA (eicosapentenoic acid 20:5(n-3), eicos- meaning 20, -penten- meaning five double bonds), and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid 22:6(n-3); docos- meaning 22, -hexaen- meaning six double bonds). With ALA, EPA and DHA are the most talked and researched after omega-3 lipids!! And indeed, there are lots of evidence that these omega-3 are good for human health (e.g., Kris-Etherton, Hecker, and Binkoski 2004). Many conjugated (i.e., alternating single and double bonds; double bonds in trans configuration) polyunsaturated fatty acids have also recently been reported to have health benefits (e.g., Pariza, Park, and Cook 2000; Kris-Etherton, Hecker, and Binkoski 2004; Benjamin and Spener 2009) . Because arachidonic acid is so widely needed and available, it is also the precursor of an entire family of fatty acid derivatives referred to as the eicosanoid lipids (eicos- meaning 20, -oid meaning “like” or “derivatives”). These are oxidated fatty acids (then referred to as oxylipins) that serve as cellular messengers in mammalians. Their names might be familiar and include prostaglandins (vasodilators) or thromboxanes (vasoconstrictors). In summary: Fatty acids are carboxylic acids so technically even acetic acid (C2) or butyric acid (C4, in butter) are fatty acids. Their hydrophobicity comes from their relative long aliphatic chains (C10 and up) Saturated fatty acids have straight aliphatic chains and take little 3D space The number and placement of unsaturated (C=C) bonds dictates their 3D shapes from a simple kink like in oleic acid to almost snail like shape for DHA When a moeity of membrane acyl-based lipids, the nature and therefore shape of the fatty acids dictates the fluidity or rigidity of the membrane 4.5.4 Glycerolipids for energy storage Nearly all the commercially important fats and oils of animal and plant origin consist almost exclusively (&gt;95%) of the simple lipid class - triacylglycerols, which are chemically inert, highly hydrophobic and have a high energy density. This includes all the vegetable oils, such as those from corn (maize), olive, palm, and sunflower, and animal fats, such as tallow, lard and butter, as well as commercial products such as margarines (Christie, n.d.). Figure 4.47: Formation of triacylglycerols by esterification of three fatty acids to a glycerol backbone Triacylglycerols are the quintessential model for the fat lipids (e.g., Figure 4.34). They are assemblages of long chain fatty acids esterified to a glycerol backbone (Figure 4.47). Fatty acids very loosely represent the equivalent of monomers in lipids, but the ester bonds do not represent true polymerization as the fatty acids are not directly bonded together, but are bonded to a backbone instead. Glycerolipids give the opportunity to reintroduce the term moiety. In a triacylglycerol, the glycerol moiety refers to as the part of the triacylglycerol that comes from the glycerol, illustrated in red in Figure 4.47. Lipids and nucleic acid monomers are assemblages of recognizable building blocks and each block in the final molecule is referred to as a moiety. The other moieties of triacylglycerol are the fatty acids. There is an entire classification of triacylglycerols depending on which glycerol atom is bonded to which fatty acid. But that is beyond what is needed here. The word triacylglycerol has been preferred over the older triglycerides. The equivalent of glycerolipids for the sugar backbone and sphingosine are covered in the sections below dedicated to saccharolipids and sphingolipids, respectively. 4.5.5 Glycerophospholipids or phospholipids for cell membranes 4.5.5.1 Phosphatidic acids as first type of third stage molecules The next stage of building blocks after the glycerolipids is the addition of a phosphate moiety to a diacylglycerol via a phosphoester bond with the remaining hydroxyl group of the glycerol moiety (Figure 4.48) to form phosphatidic acid. This molecule is an intermediate molecule for the synthesis of glycerophospholipids, built from the addition of, a least, another polar group building block. Figure 4.48: Formation of phosphatidic acid by esterification between a diacylglycerol and a phosphate Notice that because phosphoric acid has three hydroxyl groups, it can theoretically make up to 3 ester bonds. In reality, this does not happen in organic molecules for several reasons. First, the tetrahedral shape of phosphate renders difficult the possibility of binding three aliphatic chains. Second, the electronic resonance makes the third hydroxyl much less attractive to forming bonds when the two others are already involved in bonds. So, for the vast majority of cases, phosphates can only form up to two phosphoester bonds. Phosphatidic acid has two hydroxyls available for additional binding, and one of them is used to bind with the fourth stage building blocks constituted by polar groups. The phosphatidic acid becomes a substituent to the polar group and the resulting molecules are then referred to as phosphatidyl polar group name. These are the famous phospholipids that make the majority of the membrane bilayer of most plants, animals and bacteria. Another group called the glycolipids have a sugar instead of a phosphate moiety on the third stage. They are treated separately after the four stage phospholipid molecules below. 4.5.5.2 The main membrane phospholipids The quintessential phospholipid is illustrated in Figure 4.36 and is the single unit of the membrane bilayer. Again, it is thanks to its hydrophobic double tail and its hydrophylic head that the phospholipids assemble into phospholipid sheets and into phospholipid bilayers. Two of the glycerol backbone carbons are linked to fatty acids, and the third to the phosphate moeity. There are three theoretical possibilities for this assemblage. In reality, it turns out that the placement of the fatty acyl and the phosphate ester bonds on the glycerol backbone is anything but random. Chemists have thus given stereospecific numbering or sn to represent this fact. The word stereospecific has to do with the 3D configuration as rendered by the Fisher projection of the glycerol. But for us, the important fact is that the carbons of the glycerol are numbered and that the phosphate moeity is always bonded to the third carbon or is on sn-3. The only exception is the lysobisphosphatidic acid, where the phosphate moiety is on sn-1 (Christie, n.d.). Interestingly, on the first carbon of the glycerol, or on sn-1 the fatty acyl is most often saturated, and it is on the second carbon, or sn-2 that unsaturated fatty acyls may be found. This is why in all the previous figures that represented phospholipids with a bead for the hydrophilic head and lines for the tails, there always is one of the tails represented as straight, illustrating the saturated fatty acyl on sn-1 and the second tail is either straight or kinked representing the saturated or unsaturated fatty acyl, respectively, on sn-2. The diversity of phospholipids results primarily from the different assemblages of the fatty acyl on sn-1 and sn-2, and on the polar group of the hydrophilic head. There are additional phospholipids that do not strictly follow this 4-stage molecular assemblage (details below). It turns out that although there is an almost infinite number of possible combinations, in practice, some polar groups combine with a limited number of saturated and unsaturated acyl groups. Figure 4.49: Variety of phospholipids showing the five most common polar groups and fatty acyls that tend to be preponderant for each of the polar groups. The fatty acyls on sn-1 is represented as saturated as is most often the case, and the unsaturated fatty acyls on sn-2 are represented as straight aliphatic chains although there are not in reality Among the 4-stage phopsholipids, there are five well identified polar groups, which include ethanolamine, serine, choline, inositol, and glycerol. Because each of these polar groups are bound to phosphatidic acid via a phosphoester bond, they are called, respectively, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdE), phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), phosphatidylcholine (PtdChl), phosphatidylinositol (PtdIno), and phosphatidylglycerol (Figure 4.49). Phosphatidylcholine (PtdChl) is the most abundant lipid in the membranes of animal tissues; it is often a major lipid component of plant membranes, but only rarely of bacteria. With the other choline-containing phospholipid, sphingomyelin, it is a key structural component and constitutes much of the lipid in the external monolayer of the plasma membrane of animal cells especially (Christie, n.d.). Choline is an ethanolamine (see below) for which the amine group is in its cationic from (i.e., -NH3+) and where the hydrogens have been replaced by methyl groups to create (-N(CH3)3+). The positive charge on the nitrogen is compensated by the negative charge on the phosphate, making PtdChl a neutral phospholipid. The fatty acids on sn-1 tend to be 16:0 and 18:0 for both animal and plant cells, and 18:1 and 18:2 on sn-2 (Christie, n.d.), so relatively small number of unsaturated bonds compared to other phospholipids. PtdChl is rarely being found in bacteria, although it is often the main complex lipid in eukaryotes (Christie, n.d.). Phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdE) is usually the second most abundant phospholipid class in animal and plant tissues, and it can be the major lipid class in microorganisms (Christie, n.d.). Ethanolamine corresponds to an ethane or C2 with one hydroxyl group (-OH) on one carbon making ethanol, and an amine group (-NH2) on the second carbon; the two combined is called ethanolamine. It is bound to the phosphate via a phosphoester bond. The amine group in PtdE tends to be in its cationic form, making PtdE also a neutral phospholipid. The fatty acids tend to mimic those of PtdChl although there is a higher proportion of polyunsaturated (e.g., 20:4) acyls on sn-2 for animal cells. PtdE is often the most abundant lipid class in many bacterial species and may be accompanied by phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylglycerol (Christie, n.d.). Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) is a weakly acidic lipid that is present in most tissues of animals and plants and is also found in microorganisms. Under normal conditions, it is located entirely in the inner monolayer leaflet of the plasma membrane and other cellular membranes (Christie, n.d.). Serine is an amino-acid (details in section 4.3) and tends to readily bind to proteins within and outside the membrane with cytoplasmic proteins such as actins making the cytoskeleton of animal cells. The fatty acids on sn-1 tend to be 18:0 for animal cells, and be long polyunsaturated 20:4 and 22:6 on sn-2 (Christie, n.d.), so relatively high number of unsaturated bonds compared to other phospholipids. Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIno) is a common constituent of animal, plant and microbial lipids. Inositol is an interesting carbohydrate: it is a cyclohexane, for which each carbon has been oxidized and lost a hydrogen for a hydroxyl (-OH). So it has six alcohol groups or is an hexol, with the same general formula as glucose, i.e. C6H12O6. Glucose has an aldehyde group on its 6th carbon and is thus different. In animal tissues, the characteristic feature of fatty acids is a high content of stearic (18:0) and arachidonic (20:4) acids. The long tails of arachidonic acids from PtdIno on both sides of the membrane seems to be able to form hydrogen bonds, participating in the liquid-ordered phase of membranes (e.g., Figure 4.40). The hydroxyl groups of inositol react with phosphate to from inositol mono-, bi- or even tri-phosphates, all of which PtdIno play, in animal cells, important signalling and other functional activities, including cell communication via signal transduction, cell survival and proliferation, membrane trafficking and modulation of gene expression (Christie, n.d.). Phosphatidylinositols also serve as anchors to proteins (see protein anchor in Figure 4.39) in animal cells. While the previous phospholipids are common in eukaryot cells, bacterial cells tend to have different types and proportions of phospholipids. Phosphatidylglycerol is a lipid present in the three kingdoms of life although it is a major component of some bacterial membranes. The charge on the phosphate group means that it is an anionic lipid at neutral pH with a larger head group than might be expected because of hydration and with a cylindrical shape overall. Phosphatidylglycerol is found in almost all anaerobic bacterial types, representing 20-25% of the phospholipids in most Gram-negative bacteria, i.e. with a double (outer and inner) phospholipid envelope, where it is present only in the inner membrane. In Gram-positive bacteria, which have a single phospholipid bilayer coated with peptidoglycans, it can be as high as 60% of the phospholipids (together with glycosyl diacylglycerols). In cyanobacteria and plants that are able to carry out aerobic photosynthesis, phosphatidylglycerol is found in all cellular membranes - 2 to 5% of the plasma membrane. In bacteria, phosphatidylglycerol especially is widely distributed and it is found in most genera; uniquely it is the only glycerophospholipid in the membranes of certain cyanobacteria (Christie, n.d.). The last of the phospholipids presented here is cardiolipin, which was originally found in animal heart tissue (Figure 4.49). It can be seen as the condensation of two phosphatidylglycerol molecules into one. Cardiolipin is present universally in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes where it represents an important phospholipid component of specific membranes in those organelles whose function is to generate an electrochemical potential for substrate transport and ATP synthesis. Thus, it is found almost exclusively in certain membranes of bacteria (plasma membrane and hydrogenosomes) and a few species of Archaea (haloarchaea), and in mitochondria of eukaryotes (up to 20% of phospholipids) (Christie, n.d.). This phospholipid is rather negative thanks to the two negative charges of the phosphate, which may explain its role in maintaining electrochemical potentials across the membranes (see Chapter 5). There are other phospholipids described in exhaustive classifications, but this is beyond the scope of this book. Additional references include the LipidWeb, Fahy et al. (2005) and Fahy et al. (2009) as good starters. Phospholipids by definition involve phosphate as a central moiety between the backbone and the polar group. This is one of the reasons for which phosphorus and phosphate in particular are so essential for life to exist on this planet. However, we will see that phosphorus in reality is not readily available in many areas of our planet and this is why it has historically been a limiting nutrient on our planet for the longest time. This has recently changed (since the late 1950s) thanks to the mining and manufacturing of artificial fertilizers. However, because phosphorus was in so short supply, organisms have found ways to still build their membranes using the building block principle, but without using phosphate, and using hexoses instead. 4.5.5.3 Glycosyldiacylglycerols or where phosphates are replaced by sugars The title is a bit of a mouthful, one has to admit… But the idea here is that instead of a phosphate in phosphatidic acid, the diacylglycerol moiety is bonded to a sugar via a glycosidic bond. The sugar moeity, because it is linked via this glycosidic bond is called a glycosyl group, hence the name (Figure 4.50). Sugars have multiple hydroxides hence possibilities to make bonds with other hydroxides, and in this case with the last hydroxide available on the glycerol backbone of diacylglycerols. Figure 4.50: Formation of a glycosyldiacylglycerol by binding a galactose to a diacylglycerol moiety using a glycosidic bond to form the majority of the innerside of the membrane lipids of thylakoids in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria The sugars acting as backbones are galactose or digalactose (two galactoses bonded by a glycosidic bond), but also a sulfoquinovose presented in the carbohydrate section and glucuronic acid (Christie, n.d.). The three glycolipids illustrated in Figure 4.51 are the membrane lipids essential to photosynthetic tissues in both higher plants and cyanobacteria. In fact these three account for more than 85% of the membrane lipids in thylakoids of plant plastids and cyanobacteria (Kobayashi 2016). These glycoglycerolipids are equivalent to and may substitute for phosphoglycerolipids, especially when the supply of phosphorus is restricted (Essigmann et al. 1998; Güler et al. 1996). In fact, these glycolipids are the most abundant lipid classes in leaf (photosynthetic) tissues (Christie, n.d.). Figure 4.51: Three main glycolipids that make the majority of the innerside of the membrane lipids of thylakoids in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria In summary: Phospholipids are the core molecules that form membranes that allow compartmentalization in cells essential to life as they regulate exchanges and allow formation of gradients This is possible thanks to the unique assemblage of two long chain fatty acids on a glycerol backbone forming the hydrophobic side, and on the other side, a phosphate and a polar group resulting in a hydrophilic side The overall charge of the phospholipids depend on whether the negative charge of the phosphate is balanced or not by the charge of the positive charge of the polar group. Phosphatidylcholine is the most common phospholipid in eukaryot and prokaryot cells. Some organelles and cells can contain high proportion of specific phopholipids like the cardiolipin in organelles maintaining electrochemical potentials across the membrane There is a relative correlation between the fatty acid types and the polar groups Phosphate limited environments have lead certain bacteria and cyanobacteria to develop fatty acylglycerol-based membrane lipids that use sugars instead of phosphates 4.5.6 Sphingolipids use sphingosine as backbone/fatty acid The second major type of acyl-based lipids are called sphingolipids. From their original discovery from brain cells in the 1880s to modern times, sphingolipids have shown some enigmatic traits (Thudichum 1884; Merrill et al. 1997; Spiegel and Milstien 2003). The original building block is sphingosine (C18). This molecule originally discovered in brain has many of the traits of saturated fatty acids because of its long saturated aliphatic chain, yielding the same hydrophobic properties of fatty acid tails. Carbons 1 and 3 are oxydized into alcohol groups, carbon 2 has an amine group, while there is a double bond between carbons 4 and 5 (Figure 4.52). The amine group can react with the carboxyl group of a fatty acid to form an amide bond, to form ceramide, which is the equivalent of diacylglycerol or second stage molecules described above. The prefix cer- in ceramide has its roots in the word cerebral, for brain, following the early discoveries. The amide bond is rather rigid thanks to the partial double bond between the amine and the carbonyl functional groups (details in section 3.2.10), which reduces the aliphatic chain fluctuations. This with the added rigidity thanks to cholesterol molecules (details in seciion 4.5.11 below), shortens the intermolecular distances between sphingomyelin molecules and facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds between them thereby promoting the formation of a hydrogen bond network and a stable ordered phase (Christie, n.d.). The hydroxyl group on carbon 1 can bind with polar groups such as phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine, or sugars (Figure 4.52). As a result, sphingosine serves as a backbone because it can bind with a fatty acid on the hydrophobic tail end and with a polar group to form a hydrophilic head. Sphingosine also plays the role of a second fatty acid thanks to its hydrophobic saturated tail. Sphingosine is the most prevalent of the many (over one hundred!) sphingoid bases that have been identified, which differ depending on the number of carbons, whether there are two (or d- for di-) or three (or t- for tri-) hydroxyl groups, and whether there is, and the location of, a unsaturated C=C double bond, to keep it short. Sphingosine has its unsaturated bond between carbons 4 and 5, and in the trans or E (for German Entgegen) configuration (details in section 3.1.2). Sphingosine is thus abbreviated as 4E-d18:1, meaning 4E for unsaturated bond starting on carbon 4 with the Entgegen configuration, d because there are two hydroxyls on C1 and C3 (the amine group is always on C2 in sphingoid bases), 18:1 for a C18 aliphatic chain overall and one unsaturated bond. For example, bases include dihydrosphingosine which is a d18:1, phytosphingosine which is a t18:1, and dehydrophytosphingosine which is a 7E-t18:1 (Christie, n.d.). Figure 4.52: Illustration of sphingolipids and their building blocks. A fatty acid added to sphingosine, forms ceramide. Addition of phosphoethanolamine and phosphocholine polar groups form sphingomyelins, or the addition of sugar(s) form glycosphingolipids (or glucosylceramides) Many polar groups have been identified for sphingolipids including phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine, for which the resulting lipids are called sphingomyelins. Sugar based polar groups form a great variety of molecules referred to as glycosphingolipids that are very important in brain tissues. More generally, however, sphingolipids play a very important role in the membrane nanodomains, where in conjuction with cholesterol, form the liquid-ordered, gel-like phase, membrane proteins are inserted (details in section 4.5.2). The fatty acids of sphingolipids are very different from those of glycerolipids, consisting of very-long-chain (up to C26) odd- and even-numbered saturated or monoenoic (Christie, n.d.). This additionally renders the ceramide residue to have a cylindrical shape (Figure 4.45), which, in conjunction with hydrogen bonding between cholesterol and the sphingoid base residues, increase the van der Waals electrostatic forces, and favor the liquid-ordered phase of the membrane nanodomains. Finally, sphingolipids play an important, yet still relatively enigmatic, signalling function in animal organisms (Spiegel and Milstien 2003). Etymology Corner The prefix sphingos- in sphingosin or in sphingolipids is the genitive of sphinx in Greek. In Greek mythology, the sphinx is a female monster with the body of a lion, the head and breast of a woman, eagle’s wings, and a serpent’s tail. She dwelt outside the city of Thebes, and asked a riddle to all travellers, in order to let them pass and would eat those who could not answer the riddle. While working on the chemistry of the brain, the German-born British chemist J. L. W. Thudichum discovered this new type of molecules and in particular sphingosine, which presented many enigmas to its discoverer. “In commemoration of the many enigmas, which it presented to the inquirer, I have given the name of Sphingosin” (Thudichum 1884). 4.5.7 Saccharolipids in bacterial membranes The last group of acyl-based lipids include saccharolipids, where the backbone for attaching the acyl chains are sugars, namely glucosamines and sometimes glucosamine disaccharides or sugar dimers (hence the prefix saccharo- for sugar backbone, by opposition to glycero- for glycerol backbone in glycerolipids; Fahy et al. (2005)). What a mouthful, yet again…! The most infamous saccharolipid is commonly referred to as Lipid A and is the part of endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria that is inserted in outer monolayer of the outer membranes (Raetz and Whitfield 2002). Endotoxins are toxins for most animals. They are attached to the bacteria membranes themselves, as opposed to exotoxins that are released by bacteria in their environments. When bacterial cells are lysed by the mamalian immune system, fragments of membrane containing lipid A are released into the circulation, causing fever, diarrhea, and possible fatal endotoxic shock (also called septic shock). The Lipid A moiety is a very conserved component of the endotoxins. However Lipid A structure varies among bacterial species and Lipid A structure defines an overall host immune activation, sometimes violent (Wikipedia contributors 2019f). In other words, saccharolipids are bad news if they get into the blood systems of mammals… Figure 4.53: Chemical structure of lipid A as found in E. coli, and its place in the a bacterial endotoxin. Notice the two glucosamine bonded together and four fatty acids on one of them and two on the second. After Mike Jones For our purpose here, saccharolipids and lipid A in particular (Figure 4.53) have the same basic structure of a hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. The role of the hydrophobic tail is fulfilled by fatty acids. The hydrophilic head is fulfilled by the the glucosamine and the two phosphates. Lipid A corresponds to the part of endotoxins of Gram-negative bacteria that is embedded in the membrane (Figure 4.53). Endotoxins, built from a lipid anchor and a polysaccharide chain are referred to as lipopolysaccharides, a mix between carbohydrates and lipids really. In summary: Sphingolipids play an analog role as those of phospholipids in the membrane. The saturated aliphatic chain of sphingosine results in a straight aliphatic chain, as opposed to kinks observed in unsaturated fatty acids This associated with the amide bond between sphingosine and the saturated fatty acyl group generates ceramides, equivalent of diacyl-glycerols, which tend to be rather cylindrical in shape taking much less space in the membrane and less prone to move The accumulation of Sphingolipids, with that of cholesterol, near membrane nano-domains creates the conditions for the presence of liquid-ordered or gel-like phase in which membrane proteins can insert Saccharolipids are only present in bacteria membranes where they readily insert in the phospholipids membrane because of similar amphipathic properties 4.5.7.1 Other acyl-based lipids of biogeochemical significance In addition to saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl moeities, other configurations of fatty acids play an important role in the fluidity of the membrane, but they only concern prokaryotic cells, some of which of biogeochemical significance. Some fatty acids are called branched fatty acids as they have methyl groups along their aliphatic chains. s and This results in less packing of the membrane, and therefore a higher fluidity of the membrane (e.g., Poger, Caron, and Mark 2014). Figure 4.54: Examples of branched fatty acyl chains commonly found in bacterial membranes. The PPC letters stand for Palmitoyl PhosphoCholine, and the number-letter prefix varies depending on the presence, location, and number of methyl groups. (Further details in Poger, Caron, and Mark (2014)) Others are called cyclic chain fatty acids, where rings of cyclopropane (C3), cyclobutane (C4), up to cycloheptane (C7), are inserted at the ω end of the fatty acids (Figure 4.55). The effects of these ringed tails, as they increase space between fatty acid chains seem to increase the membrane fluidity, particularly for the unsaturated rings. However, the large saturated rings (C6 or C7), because of the space they take and the lack of electronic resonance, seem to reduce their own mobility, thereby reducing the overall fluidity of the membrane around them (Poger and Mark 2015b). Figure 4.55: ω-Alicyclic Fatty Acids, i.e. cyclic rings inserted in the ω position of the fatty acyl moiety having 3 to 7 carbons in the ring (from Poger and Mark (2015b)) Cyclopropane inserted within the fatty acid chains do tend to create higher fluidity of bacteria membrane (e.g., Grogan and Cronan 1997; Poger and Mark 2015a, 2015b). Some cyclopropene fatty acids have been observed in plants cells as well. They seem to inhibit desaturation during the synthesis of fatty acids and pheromones in insects and so may protect plants against insect attack (Christie, n.d.). Figure 4.56: Examples of cyclopropane fatty acids found in bacterial membranes. The PPC letters stand for Palmitoyl PhosphoCholine, and the number-letter prefix varies depending on the presence, location, and number of cyclopropane groups. (Further details in and after Poger and Mark (2015a)) Anammox bacteria, of the order of Planctomycetales, have recently been recognized to possibly have a major biogeochemical role as they can oxidize ammonium under anaerobic conditions (details in section 8.2). Ladderane lipids (named after the word ladder because of their shape) were reported in 1999, as part of the membrane lipids of the anammoxosome organelle of anammox bacteria (Sinninghe Damsté et al. 2002). These C17-C20 ladderane lipids contain three linearly concatenated cyclobutane rings and one cyclohexane or five cyclobutane rings (X and Y, respectively, in Figure 4.57. Ladderane fatty acids are esterified with methanol or the glycerol backbone, and the ladderane alcohols are ether-linked with glycerol, all in different combinations (Figure 4.57). First, these lipids seem not to have a phosphate or other polar moiety. Second, they readily assemble into very compact ladderane lipid sheets (right side of Figure 4.57), which has been surmized to largely lower the diffusion of toxic byproducts such as hydrazine (N2H4) and hydroxylamine (NH4OH) from the anammoxosome. Figure 4.57: Ladderane lipids as described in 1999 account for about 50% of the membrane lipids of the anammoxisomes. They are thought to assemble into very compact lipid sheets, giving rise to an exceptionally dense membrane, thus a tight barrier against diffusion, allowing the oxidation of ammonium under anaerobic conditions to proceed. After (Sinninghe Damsté et al. 2002) Archeabacteria, considered as the first phylogenic organism group, and now considered as one of the three groups with eubacteria and eukaryots, have membrane acyl-based lipids where the hydrophobic tails are bonded to the hydrophilic backbone through ether bond, and not ester bonds anymore (De Rosa and Gambacorta 1988). Additionally, their fatty acids are built upon isoprenoid chains (further details on isoprenoids in section 4.5.10), i.e., in this case saturated chains methylated every 4 carbons. This must affect the fluidity of the membrane. Figure 4.58: Isoprenoid diethers basic components of some complex lipids of archaebacteria (De Rosa and Gambacorta 1988) Possibly more surprising and showing how cell membranes evolved, the core membrane lipids of archeobacteria are bipolar amphipatic molecules with ‘fused’ hydrophobic isoprenoid tails, bonded with ether bonds to the hydrophilic heads on opposite sides to form isoprenoid tetraethers, and, have cyclic rings inserted in the isoprenoid tails. This can only add rigidity to the membrane, a feature that is obtained in eukaryotic cells with sphingolipids combined with cholesterol lipids. Figure 4.59: Isoprenoid tetraethers basic components of some complex lipids of archaebacteria (De Rosa and Gambacorta 1988) but cyclobutane rings seem to create higher membrane compaction (Moss et al. 2018, more details in section 4.5.13.3). Other fatty acids are oxidated and have hydroxyl groups, others have one or several triple bonds (acetylenic fatty acids), while others have nitro groups added. This is a bit anecdotal here but more details may be found on the LipidWeb. 4.5.8 Summary about the acyl-based-lipids Broadly, acyl-based lipids are at the basis of cell membrane formation, and serve as the energy storage molecules in organisms. Their long mostly-saturated aliphatic chains are able to store many electrons, which are physically stored as triacylglycerols in organisms as there are few free fatty acids. The long aliphatic chains are the reasons for the general hydrophobicity of lipids. The magic of these fatty acids (and sphingosine tails) is their ability to bind with more polar groups such as phosphate, choline, inositol, etc., thanks to a molecular backbone, giving many of the acyl-based lipids their amphipathic nature. This is the basis of all compartmentilization in living cells by the phospholipid bilayer, allowing for the creation of gradients, exchanges, barriers, etc., all needed to form organisms of several to billions of cells that need to interact and communicate together. This concludes the part on acyl-based lipids. The next part explores the lipids which structures are originally based on chains of isoprene subunits. They play a complementary role of acyl-based lipids in membranes and play a major role as messengers, e.g., in the form of vitamins and hormones. 4.5.9 Overview of the isoprene-based lipids 4.5.9.1 Isoprenoids built from isoprene subunits Everyone has heard about steroids. And everyone has heard about cholesterol. These are sterol-based lipids. They belong to a larger group of molecules, which includes prenol-based and steroid-based lipids, which have isoprene units as their common molecular skeleton. So no, you did not read monomer, you read unit, but honestly it would be tempting to use the term isoprene monomer and polymerization of isoprenes to form isoprenoid molecules or terpenes (literally derivatives of isoprenes) and their derivatives which include prenol-based and steroid-based lipids. If you thought that the acyl-based lipids were complicated, think again, because prenol-based and steroid-based lipids will take you to the next level in the intricacy of lipid chemistry! At the same time, it really is fascinating and it opens the doors to molecules and name we have all heard about: vitamins or essential oils. Etymology Corner The words isoprene and terpene have rather convoluted etymologies. In 1860, the English scientist and analytical chemist Charles Greville Williams analyzed caoutchouc and gutta percha (latex from the Palaquium tree) by destructive distillation and obtained a large quantity of a light oil which he termed isoprene (Williams 1860). The term isoprene can be analyzed from iso- (“equal; different, isomeric”) + prop- (“three carbon prefix”) + -ene (“alkene suffix”). It is really unclear how Williams came up with this name. This is an unfortunate misnomer. The word terpene is derived from the word “terpentine”, an obsolete form of the word “turpentine” (Wikipedia contributors 2019h). The latter seems to come from the Latin/French térébenthine, and Greek terebenthos (τ ε ρ ε β ι ́ ν θ ι ν ο ς), referring to the resin of the terebinth tree Pistacia terebinthus, which produces the pistachio nut. Turpentine resins, secreted by resinous trees to protect wounds or cuts in the trunks, has been harvested throughout the world. The one harvested from the long leaf pines (Pinus lacustris) of the coastal plain of the Eastern USA was highly sought after from the 17th to 19th centuries. It made the wealth of cities like Wilmington, N.C., along with tar and pitch (sticky liquids produced by burning pine branches and logs very slowly in kilns (History 2012)) used in the naval industry. The pine resin, after purification and distillation, separates into a liquid aromatic part, turpentine or oil of turpentine, and a solid part called rosin or colophony. Rosin is extensively used (among many others) for its friction-increasing capacity, particularly on bow hair of string instruments so it can grip the strings and make them speak, or vibrate clearly. Turpentine oil was used in making paint, paint thinner, and various medicines (History 2012). Many terpene molecules described in this chapter are present in the oil of turpentine. So isoprene is a C5 double unsaturated molecule (Figure 4.60), which animals and plants produce, the latter to protect leaf cells against extreme heat. It turns out that it is the assemblage of two isoprene units bonded to a pyrophosphate (called geranyl pyrophosphate - GPP; Figure 4.60) that is the beginning of many isoprenoids, otherwise also named terpenes (etymology explained above). 4.5.10 Prenol or isoprenoid lipids The name for the family comes from the alcohol version of isoprene, called prenol (Figure 4.60), where the hydroxyl group takes advantage of the original double bond on the tail of the molecule (carbon 4; Figure 4.60), which relocates the remaining double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (Figure 4.60). Geranyl pyrophosphate is at the basis of many polyprenols and just about all terpenes. Polyprenols play an important function acting as natural bioregulators and are found in small quantities in various plant tissues (Wikipedia contributors 2019c). Figure 4.60: Isoprene and prenols; Geranyl pyrophosphate is the precursor of most terpenes or isoprenoids. Geranyl pyrophosphate is formed from DiMethylAllyl PyroPhosphate (DMAPP) and its isomer Isopentanyl PyroPhosphate (IPP) 4.5.10.1 Many familiar isoprenoids Isoprenoids or terpenes have several important characteristics: they tend to be very aromatic, have the tendency to not stay as straight molecules as depicted in Figure 4.60, but rather to fold into carbon rings. Figure 4.61: Examples of two monoterpenes formed by the propensity of prenols to form cycles. After Fred the Oysteri and Hbf878 Because geranyl-pyrophosphate is the initial building block of most terpenes, and because it has two isoprene units (Figure 4.60), terpenes tend to have even numbers of isoprene units (although there are many isoprenoids with odd numbers of isoprene units, e.g. Table 4.2). Hemiterpenes, Monoterpenes, Sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes, and tetraterpenes respectively refer to isoprenoids with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 isoprene subunits (Table 4.2). Table 4.2: Examples of common terpenes and terpenoids. Terpenoids are derivatives of terpenes as they contain additional oxygen atoms, while terpenes only contain C and H atoms. Isoprene subunits are illustrated in alternating red and blue Terpene type Examples Hemiterpenoids (half-terpene) Monoterpenoids Sesquiterpenoids (one &amp; a half terpene) Diterpenoids Triterpenes Tetraterpenes The propensity of prenols to form cycles is at the basis of the formation for example of the lanosterol, precursor of all steroid lipids, from squalene (a common oil found in shark liver; Table 4.2 and Figure 4.65). Vitamin A (retinol) is a bi-product of β-carotene, both of which exhibit carbon rings (Table 4.2). Carotene is a photosynthetic pigment important for photosynthesis absorbing in the ultraviolet, violet, and blue light and scatter orange or red light, and (in low concentrations) yellow light. Carotene is responsible for the orange color of the carrots (hence its name) and many other fruits and vegetables. As a precursor to vitamin A, carotenes, must be ingested by humans. Xanthophylls are photosynthetic pigments giving the yellow color, even in egg yolk, located mostly in leaves where they act to modulate light energy. They are very close to, and essentially are oxygenated versions of carotenes (Table 4.2). The cycling propensity of isoprenoids also exist for many aromatic terpenes referred to as essential oils. Contrary to what the word essential means for fatty acids or amino acids, i.e., that humans do not synthesize them and must be acquired through food, essential oils refer to the propensity of these molecules to become very volatile and contain the “essence of” the plant’s fragrance. Molecules such as geraniol are found on the leaves of geranium plants, geranial or citral give a strong lemon (citrus) odor, limonene is found in many citrus plants, pinene in pine, thymol in thyme, menthol in mint (actually a terpenoid because it has an oxygen atom, and not a terpene sensu stricto, which have only carbon atoms), humalene in humulus lupulus or hops in Latin, etc. In fact, many students have heard about terpenes because they are synthesized on the trichomes or plant hair of cannabis leaves, and offer various aromas for their use, along with possible medical benefits. Isoprene and many essential oils, being very volatile, are closely involved in production of the air pollutant, ozone. In addition, when they are oxidized by atmospheric ozone, ·OH, or NOx radicals, aerosols may form that cause scattering of the sunlight; since the intensity of the scattering is proportional to \\(1/ \\lambda^4\\), the short wavelengths λ are enhanced in the scattered light, making it look blue (Rayleigh scattering). This is the main explanation for, e.g., the appearance and the name of the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina which hosts many conifer species. Some authors question whether the ‘essential oils’ and many terpenoids belong to the lipid family at all (e.g., Christie (n.d.)), but we thought that it was a missed opportunity not to mention them here. 4.5.10.2 Vitamins E and K Finally, isoprenoid side chains are present in quinone based isoprenoids such as vitamin K, needed for blood coagulation (Koagulation in Danish), plastoquinone and ubiquinone involved in the electron transport chains of, respectively, the chloroplasts and mitochondria. The long isoprenoid chains of plasto- and ubiquinone allow these molecules to readily insert within the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane of these organelles. Figure 4.62: Quinone based isoprenoids including vitamin K, needed for blood coagulation (Koagulation in Danish), plastoquinone and ubiquinone involved in the electron transport chains of, respectively, the chloroplasts and mitochondria. The quinone functional group is represented in magenta The ubiquinone can be an electron transport molecule thanks to the quinone moeity, which can accept two electrons and be reduced into ubiquinol (Figure 4.63). It can easily be oxidized back into ubiquinone thanks to the electron resonance of the quinone moeity, and therefore ‘liberate’ its electrons to be ready to transport more electrons during the electron transfer chain. Ubiquinone is often referred to as the coenzyme Q. Figure 4.63: The reduction of ubiquinone (or coenzyme Q) to ubiquinol (QH2). The quinone functional group is represented in magenta Tocol-based isoprenoids like tocopherols and tocotrienols, collectively known as tocochromanols (Christie, n.d.) including molecules such as vitamin E, are essential for animals and humans, which must ingest enough of them for their growth. In plants, they are especially important as antioxidant molecules, limiting the damage from photosynthesis-derived reactive oxygen species during conditions of oxidative stress, including high-intensity light stress (Christie, n.d.). Figure 4.64: Tocol-based isoprenoids including vitamin E, essential for animals and humans, and acting as important antioxidant molecules In summary: Prenol or isoprenoid lipids comprise a very large number of molecules based on the common isoprene C5 building unit. Molecules with C and H atoms only are called terpenes, the others isoprenoids Isoprenoids have the propensity to be assembled in pairs because geranyl pyrophosphate (two isoprene units) is the molecule upon which most of them are built. As a result, molecules with 4, 6, or 8 isoprene units are called di-, tri-, and tetraterpenes(oids) Isoprenoids have the propensity to form carbon rings, which are among the reasons why they are so aromatic to our olfactory sense. Essential oils, although not always classified as lipids, provide everyday life experience of isoprenoids in the smell of mint, pine, lemon, thyme, lavender, etc. Isoprenoids such as carotene, xanthophyll (tetraterpenoids) play a major role in capturing light energy in photosynthesis, while plasto- and ubiquinone play a major role in the electron transfer chain in the chloroplast and mitochondrion membranes Vitamin A, E, and K are prenol lipids 4.5.11 Sterol lipids 4.5.11.1 Cholesterol and oxysterols The most famous of the sterol lipid is cholesterol as it plays an essential role in the animal cell membrane rigidity as already described in section 4.5.2 above. All sterol lipids are derived from the triterpene squalene (Table 4.2 and 4.65), eventually leading to two slightly different precursors: lanosterol for animals and fungi, and cycloartenol for plants and algae. Because of this distinction, phyto- and zoosterols are a bit different. Sterol and steroid lipids all have fused rings and a planar geometry, which gives them rigidity and strength. As a result, they play an essential role in membrane stability and particularly in lipid rafts where the membrane has less a fluidic property, and more of gel like properties (details in section 4.5.2). Figure 4.65: Synthesis of lanosterol and cycloartenol, the precursors of respectively the zoo- and phytosterols lipids from DiMethylAllyl PyroPhosphate (DMAPP) and its isomer Isopentanyl PyroPhosphate (IPP), geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), to squalene, before it goes into cyclization to form four fused carbon rings Zoo- and phytosterols are consistent within their kingdoms, but in reality extremely close at the molecular scale and in their functions of stabilizing the cell membranes near nano-domains and stabilizing proteins in the membrane as cholesterol may strongly bind to them (Christie, n.d.). Zoosterols are based upon cholesterol molecule, a C27 molecule, or triterpene that has lost 3 methyl groups. The oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol are called oxysterols and correspond to the partial oxidation of cholesterol (e.g., cerebrosterol in Figure 4.66). Etymology Corner The English word cholesterol, comes from the French cholestérol, itself derived from the word cholesterine proposed by French chemist Michel Engène Chevreul in 1816: “Je nommerai cholesterine, de χολη [choli], bile, et στερεος [stereos], solide, la substance cristallisée des calculs biliares humains, … I will name cholesterine — from χολη (bile) and στερεος (solid) — the crystalized substance from human gallstones …” (Chevreul 1816). François Poulletier de la Salle seems to be the first actual discoverer of cholesterol crystals in 1758 or 1769 although he did not publish his results, which were later quoted by his collaborators. 4.5.11.2 Phytosterols and hopanoids Higher plant sterols are very close to animal cell cholesterol, with the variations on the C24 (additions of methyl or ethyl groups) and double bonds between C22 and C23 (e.g., campesterol in Figure 4.66). Ergosterol, the main sterol in fungi and yeasts, has an additional double bond between C7 and C8 (Figure 4.66). It is remarkable to observe that there is little variation in animal sterols, cholesterol being the dominant form, other than the oxidative derivatives, while there are more than 8 plant sterols identified, with small variations among them. Figure 4.66: Cholesterol is the most common zoosterol. Cerebrosterol is an oxidated derivative of cholesterols in animals. Ergosterol is the equivalent of cholesterol for fungi and yeast. Campesterol is one of the many plant sterols characterized by additional side chains on the C24. All atoms and bonds differing from the animal cell cholesterol are highlighted in red Bacteria and other prokaryotic organisms such as blue-green algae do not in general contain any of the conventional sterols found in plants and animals (there are always exceptions), but rather many species have related molecules, i.e. pentacyclic triterpenoids based on a hopane skeleton with four cyclohexane rings and a cyclopentane E-ring and termed ‘hopanoids’ Perhaps the most abundant hopanoid in living organisms is tetrahydroxybacteriohopane (Christie, n.d.). Figure 4.67: Tetrahydroxybacteriohopane, the most abundant hopanoid in bacteria and other prokaryotic organisms, has very similar functions to those of sterols in the membranes of animals and plants in that they can intercalate into phospholipid bilayers and modulate the fluidity of membranes by interacting with their complex lipid components 4.5.11.3 Steroid signal molecules Among the most remarkable sterol lipids are the steroid hormones, and particularly the sex hormones and cholecalciferol hormone better known as vitamin D. Estradiol and testoterones have lost the aliphatic chain of the reference cholesterol. Estradiol is a naturally occurring hormone that circulates endogenously within the human body. It is the most potent form of mammalian estrogenic steroids and acts as the major female sex hormone. As such, estradiol plays an essential role in the regulation of the menstrual cycle, in the development of puberty and secondary female sex characteristics, as well as in ageing and several hormonally-mediated disease states. Testosterone is the most important androgen, i.e., the major male sex hormone, in potency and quantity. It is remarkable to see how apparently relatively small differences between the two molecules can make such fundamental differences! Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is a steroid hormone produced in the skin when exposed to ultraviolet light or obtained from dietary sources. The active metabolite of cholecalciferol, calcitriol plays an important role in maintaining blood calcium and phosphorus levels and mineralization of bone. Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism. Figure 4.68: Estradiol and testoterone as the major female and male sex hormones, respectively. All differences in atoms and bonds are highlighted in orange and green. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is a metabolite of cholesterol and necessary for the calcium and phosphate regulation in the human body The transport of sterol lipids through vascular animal organisms is problematic because, despite the hydroxyl group of the A carbon ring of cholesterol (Figure 4.66) that make sterol lipids somewhat polar, cholesterol is insoluble in water, very much like all lipids and in particular triglycerides. A specialized type of pseudo-organelles called lipoproteins transports hydrophobic lipids through the body. This organelle is formed by a single layer of phospholipids assembled as a sphere creating a hydrophilic outer surface soluble in water, and a hydrophobic compartment inside in which cholesterol, cholesterol esters and triglycerides are stored. Inserted proteins called apolipoproteins provide structural, communication and enzymatic activities. Figure 4.69: Chylomicron, or the largest of the lipoproteins which serve in transporting lipids in vascular animal organisms. T: Triglycerides; C: Cholesterol; ApoA, ApoB, ApoC, ApoE: lipoproteins By Xvazquez Depending on the size of the sphere, scientists have named these High Density Lipoproteins (HDL; 5-12 nm diameter), Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL; 18-25 nm diameter), Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL; 25-35 nm diameter), Very Low Density Lipoproteins (VLDL; 30-80 nm diameter), and chylomicrons (75-1200 nm diameter) (Feingold and Grunfeld 2018). The HDL and LDL acronyms are rather well known and are common indicators reported in routine blood analyzes. Cholesterol in lipoproteins is often esterified with fatty acids to form sterol esters, making the molecules much less polar than free cholesterol. Interestingly, cholesterol is not metabolized by humans as a source of energy, despite the fact that it stores quite a few electrons. Instead, cholesterol is a precursor of hormones, vitamin D, and its metabolites (e.g., bile acids) serve as surfactant in the digestive system to help digestion and assimilation of nutrients and essential molecules (e.g., amino-acids, monosaccharides, essential fatty acids). In summary: Almost all sterol and steroid lipids have four fused rings and a planar geometry, which gives them rigidity and strength. These properties are essential for their functions in cell membranes They are all derived from the triterpene squalene Zoo- and phytosterols play an essential role in the membrane nanodomains by rendering the membrane in a liquid-ordered phase, i.e., more gel-like and more rigid Sterols tend not to serve as a source of energy in animals, but rather are degraded into metabolites that serve as surfactant in the digestive system to help digestion and assimilation of nutrients and essential molecules (e.g., amino-acids, monosaccharides, essential fatty acids) Animal sterols (with triglycerides) being hydrophobic are carried in the blood in specialized single phospholipid layered vesicles called lipoproteins, the most known of which are HDL and LDL, usually in the form of sterol esters Essential metabolites of cholesterol include sexual hormones and vitamin D 4.5.12 Summary about the isoprene-based lipids Broadly, isoprene-based lipids are all based on isoprene units, which have the capacity to stay as linear chains, or form saturated and unsaturated carbon rings. The cyclization is complete with sterol lipids where mostly four fused rings and a planar geometry are at the basis of the structural strength of many zoo- and phytosterols when inserted in the acyl-based bilayer of membranes. Sterol metabolites such as steroid hormones play a major role in the development of animals. Isoprenoids such as prenol lipids play important role in energy capturing and electron transfer, as well as communication molecules, including vitamins and hormones. This concludes the part on isoprene-based lipids. The next part briefly presents other lipids or biological importance we thought would fit better in their own part. 4.5.13 Other notable lipids 4.5.13.1 Waxes as fatty acid esters There is no satisfactory definition of the word “wax” in chemical terms. It is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word “weax” for beeswax, so a practical definition of a wax may therefore be “a substance similar in composition and physical properties to beeswax”. Biochemists often link waxes with the thin layer of fatty constituents that cover the leaves of plants or provide a surface coating for insects or the skin of animals for which primary requirements are spreadability and chemical and metabolic stability. Such surface waxes are produced by specialized cells or glands, and all tend to contain wax esters as major and perhaps defining components, i.e. esters of long-chain fatty alcohols with long-chain fatty acids. (Christie, n.d.). Most waxes are formed by two (fatty acid + fatty alcohol) or three moieties (fatty acid + fatty alkane-di-ol + fatty acid), in which case they are referred to as diester waxes. Waxes form the cuticle of plant leaves, but are also secreted by specialized glands in animals, in which case they tend to be associated with triacylglycerols and/or sterol esters. The uropygial gland of birds produces waxes gives feathers their water tightness. Spermaceti or the substance present in sperm whale and skulls of other dolphin and whales, is made by 75% of cetyl palmitate and 25% of triacylglycerols. The other animal wax of commercial value is wool wax of lanolin having waterproofing properties that aids sheep in shedding water from their coats. Lanolin contains up to 50% wax esters and 33% sterol (lanosterol) esters (Christie, n.d.). 4.5.13.2 Polyketides Polyketides are a large group of secondary metabolites which either contain alternating carbonyl and methylene groups (-CO-CH2-) (Wikipedia contributors 2020). Many mycotoxins produced by fungi are polyketides or polyketide derivatives and many are commonly used as antimicrobial, antiparasitic, and anticancer agents. Important examples of these drugs include erythromycins, tetracylines, nystatins, avermectins, and antitumor epothilones (Fahy et al. 2005). Fahy et al. (2005) classify them as lipids while others (e.g., Christie (n.d.)) do not. 4.5.13.3 Natural cyclic fatty acid based lipids Branched-chain fatty acids are common in bacterial and archaeal membranes where their concentration often exceeds that of linear-chain fatty acids. The variations in the presence, nature, and number of branching groups in fatty acids lead to distinct physicochemical properties of the lipids that in turn result in biological membranes with unique structural and functional properties (Poger and Mark 2015b). Some bacteria and Archea have peculiar fatty acids chains that include cyclic The physiological rationale for cyclopropane ring formation in bacterial membranes remains obscure. There are many other lipids that have been described in detail (e.g., Fahy et al. (2005); Christie (n.d.)), but we decided that they would not aid to synthesize what lipids are. In summary: “Lipids are fatty acids and their derivatives, and substances related biosynthetically or functionally to these compounds” (Christie, n.d.) Long aliphatic chains may store many electrons and lipids are thus energy storage molecules Fatty acyl chains open the possibility for amphiphatic properties with hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads, which allows the formation of very tight membranes and compartmentalization of the cell Phosphates play an essential role in the structure of acyl-based membrane lipids and on the polar nature of the heads (along with moeities containing nitrogen) The methylated and unsaturated aliphatic chains (e.g., isoprenoids), tend to form carbon rings, yielding lipids such as sterols which are small, yet strong enough to rigidify cell membranes References "],

The transfer of energy and electrons can be summarized in respiration schemes illustrating the electron donors, acceptors, and the byproducts of oxidation and reduction. Us humans have the freedom to go about as we wish. All we need is to eat, drink, breath, and eliminate what we do not need. We could take our automobile cars as another example of bodies able to move about as long as they are fed some fuel. A lot of energy is released from combustion of fuel or wood. In fact, provided that this energy be funneled into some very smart mechanical systems (e.g., combustion engines), and the energy power delivered is largely superior to any power any human could output. However, the energy consumed is also phenomenal and much of it is lost through heat. Life has found a way to be a lot more parsimonious with energy spending, which makes living organisms to be a lot more energy efficient than combustion in the long run: the respiration process. But in both the cases of combustion or of respiration, energy is liberated or transferred to ATP, respectively, when electrons are transferred from an electron donor to an electron acceptor. Not surprisingly, life and its diversity as we know it, has been able to develop on our planet because primary producers have been able to transfer and store solar energy into a chemical energy, where electrons are effectively stored onto organic molecules, and, because dioxygen O2, the most powerful electron acceptor, is freely floating in our atmosphere. But, then if we ourselves are nothing but a lot of organic matter, therefore a very large source of electrons, and if we leave in an oxygenated environment, how come we are not going into combustion? Obviously this applies to all living organisms. Some of you might think that it is because of the water. But then why would not a very dry piece of paper, or leaves, not automatically catch on fire? The answer lays in two words: activation energy. Electrons do not readily transfer from an electron donor to an electron acceptor because of the activation energy barrier which must be overcome. Activation energy is the level of energy necessary to be overcome for a reaction to carry on. On the Figure below borrowed from Wikipedia, the energy difference between the peaks and the final energy level corresponds to the activation energy Ea. Figure 5.1: Activation Energy (Ea) needed for a reaction to proceed. (Ea) can be lowered thanks to a catalyst, and in the case of the respiration chain of living organisms, many of them. Figure borrowed from Nature Scitable, Copyrighted free use In normal conditions, this energy is preventing a reaction to proceed. This is why wood or most organic matter do not go into combustion or decomposition on their own. Nitroglycerin is notoriously unstable and the activation energy for electrons to be transferred to O2 is very small, hence its propensity to explode and its danger. However, the activation energy can be overcome with enough heat brought near an electron donor in the form of a flame or a spark. Not much heat is necessary for natural gas (CH4) for combustion to take place, i.e., for transfer of electrons from the carbon to oxygen: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_4 + 2 O_2 \\Rightarrow CO_2 + 2 H_2O \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] Because there are as many moles of reactant gases as there are of product gases, this reaction is not explosive, which is the reason why we can use it without danger for cooking and heating. Overall, it is possible to summarize in an electron transfer flow scheme (Figure 5.2) the transfer of electrons from methane, i.e., the electron donor, to dioxygen, i.e., the electron acceptor, the byproduct of carbon losing its electrons is CO2 and that of oxygen gaining electrons is H2O (and CO2 as well). Figure 5.2: Summry of the transfer of electrons during oxidative combustion of methane, illustrating the electron donor, acceptor, the byproducts, and the energy released A lot of energy in methane combustion is thus generated but almost instantaneously and is not really ubiquitous and certainly not reversible at an affordable energy cost… So clearly life had to find better solutions: to generate energy in a process which would allow the energy delivery not to be too large, and not burn up as such would have the products or elements of energy delivery be recyclable, or the energy system be refillable at the molecular scale 5.2 Generating energy without combustion: ATP or the energy currency of the cell Now because none of us and all the living organisms with us, burn to generate energy, there must be other systems to manage to liberate energy, and, there must be ways to have much lower activation energy. Life has found several mechanisms to optimize the transfer of energy from organic matter to a magic molecule: ATP or Adenosine TriPhosphate. There are many ways of transferring energy. To heat a house in the western world, we most often have a centralized heating (and sometimes cooling) system, where the heat is generated, e.g., in a furnace, and then transferred to the rest of the house via pipes and the like. The equivalent system might be for mammals the blood that gets re-oxygenated with the lungs, before it delivers oxygen throughout the body. At the cellular level, however, ATP or Adenosine TriPhosphate is created throughout the cell near the equivalent of the little furnaces: an entire organelle called mitochondria in eukaroytic cells, and ATPases directly at the innermembrane of prokaryotic cells. Needless to say, there is no combustion with the mitochondria or at the bacteria membrane, and yet there is transfer of electrons and energy delivered. The energy is transferred from the organic matter to ATP, and ATP being a relatively small molecule, can easily reach all metabolic processes, usually operated by proteins, which need energy to proceed (to overcome the activation energy mentioned above). Figure 5.3: ATP molecular structure containing adenosine (= adenine + ribose) and the three phosphate linked together with a pyrophosphate energy rich bond. Copyrighht Pearson Benjamin Cummings The key to storing energy is in the instability of the bond between the phosphates, which are often referred to as “high-energy bonds” (Lipmann 1941), although this denomination has been heavily criticized because it might be misleading (e.g., Lehninger 1965). The hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate bond or diphospho anhydride linkages in ATP releases a lot of energy (ΔG°′ = -32 kJ mol-1), hence the original naming of Lipmann (1941). A common representation of this reaction is \\(ATP \\Rightarrow ADP + P_i\\) with the Pi referring to as a dioxygenated phosphate, i.e., a phosphoryl \\(-PO_3^{2-}\\). In practice though and as represented in Figure 5.4, the same reaction is actually \\(ATP + H_2O \\Rightarrow ADP + HPO_4^{3-} + H^+\\) (Figure 5.4). But in reality, it is not the ‘breaking of’ the pyrophosphate bond that releases energy as most bond breaking are endergonic (consume energy), but rather it is the fact that the molecular products (ADP +Pi) are more stable than ATP as all the bonds in ADP and in phosphate are lower in energy. Indeed, there seems to be three factors explaining the exergonic nature of of ATP hydrolysis (Moran 2012): the concentration of electrons at the diphospho anhydride bond creates great instability between bonded phosphate tetrahedra (Degens 1989) because of electrostatic repulsion among the negatively charged oxygen atoms the products of hydrolysis, ADP and inorganic phosphate, or AMP and inorganic pyrophosphate, are better solvated than ATP itself. When ions are solvated, they are electrically shielded from each other. The decrease in the repulsion between phosphate groups helps drive hydrolysis (Moran 2012) the products of hydrolysis are more stable than ATP. The electrons on terminal oxygen atoms are more delocalized than those on bridging oxygen atoms, creating resonance stabilization All of this, combined with the fact that the ATP:ADP ratio is maintained around 1,000 in cells, leads to the fact that ATP is the main source of energy transfer in cells and as such is referred to as the energy currency of the cell. The exergonic nature of the ATP hydrolysis is the fundamental principle for the release of energy from ATP, Adenosine Tri-Phosphate. Figure 5.4: Release of energy ATP hydrolyzed into ADP. http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/atp.html Now that we have allocated electrons on atoms and molecules, you easily understand that the number of electrons on the outside of the triplet \\(PO_3-O-PO_2-O-PO_2\\) is huge. In his fantastic book, Degens (1989) suggests that because of the plethora of electrons on the triphosphate part of ATP, because the tetrahedral phosphate molecules are linked together by one of the corners of each tetrahedron (Figure 5.5), and because of the \\(\\pi\\) electron bonds (double bond) which tends to repulse each other (Degens 1989), the triphosphate molecule can only be in constant movement, which ‘maintains the animated world’ (Degens 1989). Figure 5.5: Tetrahedral configuration of each of the phosphate molecule which when linked together supposedly are in constant movement 5.3 The ATP manufacture 5.3.1 Substrate-level versus oxidative phosphorylation The beauty of \\(ATP \\Rightarrow ADP + P_i + energy\\) is that the ingredients to store the energy are still there, namely ADP and Pi and their oxidation states have not changed, or in other words, they have not lost electrons. Manufacturing back ATP is thus possible within the cell by reversing the previous reaction into \\(ADP + P_i + energy \\Rightarrow ATP\\). Obviously, this reaction requires to energize the electrons of the phosphate back to a higher level to recreate the diphospho anhydride bond. If ATP freely releases energy for a reaction to proceed in the cell, as ATP becomes ADP + Pi, there must be energy at one point to ‘manufacture’ or recharge the ATP molecule in the first place. We have seen that much of the energy in the cell is transferred thanks to the ATP molecule. So could one just make ATP from the energy liberated by ATP? The answer is no, obviously… The energy to create ATP has to come from elsewhere, otherwise it just cannot work. Life has found two wonderful ways to recreate the diphospho anhydride bond thanks to what are referred to as substrate-level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation. The substrate-level phosphorylation is reviewed later in the glycolysis part of this chapter. These two phosphorylations occur within two main suites of processes called respiration and fermentation. The big difference between respiration and fermentation is the presence or absence, respectively, of exogenous electron acceptors (Figure 5.6). Both respiration and fermentation start with a cascade of reactions collectively referred to as Glycolysis. The suffix -lysis means ‘breaking’ and the prefix glyco- stands for glucose. Glycolysis is the suite of processes that break glucose, and in fact break glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. Although more details are provided in the a dedicated section, glycolysis results in the net formation of 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation and the transfer of 4 electrons out of each glucose molecule. The formation of 2 ATP during glycolysis can only continue to occur if the 4 electrons taken out of glucose have some place to be accepted. Otherwise, glycolysis stops. In abscence of exogenous electron acceptors, i.e., electron acceptors from outside the cell, these four electrons are accepted onto organic molecules to form well known products such as ethanol, acetic acid, lactic acid, butyric acid, or even H2 (details in the the fermentation part of this chapter). In the end, most of the electrons originally stored on glucose are still stored onto organic molecules in fermentation. And this is one reason why fermentation provides little energy in the form of ATP (only 2 ATP for each glucose molecule). Figure 5.6: Transfer of electrons from glucose generates 18 times more ATP in respiration than in fermentation. Most of the ATP (30-32 or 90%; illustrated in red text) is produced during the oxidative phosphorylation of respiration, while 4 ATP (10%) are produced by substrate-level phosphorylation (illustrated in green text) during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. Electrons transported on organic molecules are framed in rectangle boxes, and those tranported on Electron Transfer Molecules are framed in ‘explosion boxes’ Reversely, in respiration, the 24 electrons originally on the glucose can be all transferred to exogenous electron acceptors. The big difference occurs after glycolysis: all the electrons stored on glucose eventually power the oxidative phosphorylation processes (Figure 5.6). The twenty four electrons originally stored on glucose generate up to 36 ATP molecules, or 1.5 molecules of ATP per electron transferred on average, compared to 0.5 ATP produced per electron transferred during glycolysis, and thus in fermentation. Obviously the mechanism for creating ATP after glycolysis must be very different in respiration than in fermentation. And the difference is in the oxidative phosphorylation that occurs after the Krebs cycle. There must be a secret for oxidative phosphorylation to be so much more efficient. The next section explores this secret. Because the oxidative phosphorylation generates about 90% of ATP produced, the next section are focused on this very process. Description of the glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are provided afterwards, although they truly occur upstream of the oxidative phosphorylation, because both are associated with substrate level phosphorylation. 5.4 Respiration: providing most ATP thanks to exogenous electron acceptors and oxidative phosphorylation Again, respiration involves a cascading series of three suites of reactions/processes called: Glycolysis the Krebs or citric acid cycle, and the oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 5.6) For prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, most of the ATP are synthesized thanks to the oxidative phosphorylation of respiration as mentioned above (Figure 5.6; more details below). For eukaryotic cells, glycolysis takes place outside of the mitochondria, while the Krebs or citric acid cycle (named after Sir Hans Adolph Krebs) and the oxidative phosphorylations take place inside the mitochondria (Figure 5.7). Figure 5.7: Summary of cellular respiration with the ATP and electron transfer budget. Obtained from https://cdn.thinglink.me/api/image/847806852426104839/1240/10/scaletowidth The secret is that in oxidative phosphorylation, the energy of the electron is transferred into chemiosmosis, or an accumulation of protons inside designated compartments and organelles, which creates a proton gradient that drives a powerful proton flow at the equivalent of valves literally providing a mechanical force, referred to as the Proton Motive Force. ATP is formed from an ADP and a dehydroxylated phosphate (i.e., a phosphoryl) and assembled thanks to a protein called ATP synthase, or ATPase, which is activated or powered mechanically, very much like a water mill, by a proton flow (Figure 5.8), which mechanically forces the diphospho anhydride bond to be created (Figures 5.8 and 5.9) while the electrons are energized. This is the secret of the efficiency (at least 3 times more) of the oxidative, compared to substrate level phosphorylation. Figure 5.8: Artist representation of the ATP synthase powered, almost mechanically by proton flows. By The original uploader was Asw-hamburg at German Wikipedia - Transferred from de.wikipedia to Commons by Leyo using CommonsHelper., CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8993938 The ATPase has a base embedded in the membrane, referred to as the FO region, and a ‘head’, which looks a bit like a ‘mushroom hat’ (Figure 5.9). The so called C-subunit ring rotates in the so called a-subunit of the base of the ATPase as a result of the proton flow and allows the phosphorylation of ADP. It is thus fair to call the ATPase a ‘proton mill’. Figure 5.9 shows very nicely how the mechanical force of the H+ flow is thought to allow the phosphoryl radical Pi to be attached to an ADP. In summary, this mechanical force is what generates the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. So this solves that part of the ATP synthesis. Now, another mechanism must be responsible for the formation of the proton flow. Figure 5.9: ATP synthase in action. Obtained with permission from HarvardX To make sure there be no confusion here, the expression phosphorylation corresponds to the effective addition of a phosphoryl \\(-PO_3^{2-}\\) radical to the diphosphate part of ADP (Figure 5.10). This is why the phosphorylation of ADP is summarized as \\(ADP + P_i \\Rightarrow ATP\\), where Pi is used to represent a phosphoryl group. Despite this, we still refer to as triphosphate for the ATP molecule, because practically a phosphoryl group is a dehydroxylated phosphate. The OH- produced combines with the flow of protons to form water. Figure 5.10: Phosphorylation: addition of a phosphoryl group to ADP to form ATP 5.4.1 Creating a proton gradient as a source of proton flow Until now, we have hardly mentioned where all this takes place. We are about to see where this happens. But first, let us take an analogy to better understand the proton flow responsible for the synthesis of ATP. Flow of matter just does not happen on its own, it only happens as a result of a gradient between a compartment and another. Using the water mill analogy, the reason why there is release of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the water is because there is a drop in elevation, and therefore in potential energy between the ‘compartments’ upstream and downstream the mill. To increase the hydraulic gradient, men throughout the world have built dams to create compartments and increase the hydraulic gradient between upstream and downstream the mill. So in the water mill analogy, the hydraulic gradient is maintained thanks to the dam which creates compartments, and to the continuous arrival of new water upstream and to the leaving of water downstream. So four things are necessary for the wheel to turn by the release of kinetic energy (which in the end and in the old days would grind wheat or corn grain; Figure 5.11): a system to compartmentalize water, a supply of water, a water mill rotation powered by water momentum, and, an outlet for the water so that is does not accumulate. Figure 5.11: The mechanical force of water flow to rotate a water mill wheel is possible thanks to the maintenance of water head gradient between upstream and downstream of the wheel. This gradient exists and is maintained thanks to a dam which creates upstream and downstream compartments, the supply of water upstream, and enough channel slope such that water does not accumulate downstream. After Malcolm.boura By analogy, the formation of ATP corresponds to the grain grinding; the proton flow corresponds to the water flowing that activates the mill wheel, and in our case the proton flow activates the ATPase. We now need to address the four parts of the system needed to have a proton gradient and flow, and a rotation of the ATPase: a compartment system in the intermembrane space, a proton supply system (to the intermembrane space), the ATP synthase powered by a proton flow exerting a Proton Motive Force, and, a system to use protons (in the outer membrane space) so the gradient is maintained. 5.4.2 A compartment to accumulate protons We saw earlier that the double phospholipid layer made the cell membrane. Well if one closes a membrane on itself, one will make a compartment or a balloon. It turns out that if one looks at a typical prokaryotic cell and at organelles in a eukaryotic cell (Figure 5.12), there are compartments formed between a cell wall and the plasma membrane for prokaryotic cells, and between two double layer phospholipid membranes for the eukaryotic cells. So in reality, it is a bit as if one were to create a space between two balloons. Figure 5.12: Artist representation of a prokaryotic cell and a mitochondrion from a eukaryotic showing the intermembrane spaces: between the cell wall and plasma membrane for the prokaryotic cell, and, between the outer and inner membranes for the mitochondrion. https://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/animals/animalmodel.html and By Kelvinsong - Own work, CC0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=27715320 At the end though, there exists for prokaryotic cells and mitochondria (and most organelles for eukaryotic cell) an outer and an inner membrane, which effectively create intermembrane spaces or compartments to accumulate ‘things’. The double phospholipid membrane is so strong and so tight that it is quite proton-tight, in part thanks to the cardiolipin phospholipids. In other words, if somehow protons accumulate in this intermembrane space, protons cannot leave easily through the membrane through diffusion, but rather can leave through designated areas. And yes, you guessed right, the designated area for protons to leave the intermembrane space is the ATP synthase. So to take another analogy, you can imagine an inner tube full of air under pressure, and although air can leave through the inner tube over long periods (that is why tires eventually go flat), air can only leave through the valve in large volumes. And if you were to put a little fan in front of the valve as you are releasing air, the fan would rotate. Imagine that this is essentially what happens: the ATPase is both the valve and the fan as it literally rotates with the proton flow. 5.4.3 A supply of protons for the intermembrane space: proton pumps Now, the next natural question is that in the case of an inner tube, somebody pumped some air into the tube to put it under pressure. Similarly, there must be a system that pumps protons into the inter-membrane space. And yes indeed, there are proton pumps that do the job. But again, these pumps must be powered by some sort of energy. Let us pause for a second. We have seen in section 5.1 that generally speaking, energy is generated from the transfer of electrons. But until now, we have not even mentioned electrons: only ATP and protons…? This is where electrons come in: energetic electrons transported onto electron transfer molecules are the ones that power the proton pumps! It is time to take a bird’s eye view again. Energy liberation exists when electrons are transferred from an electron donor to an electron acceptor. Life has found a way to capture this energy in the form of ATP, which allows transportation of energy to the needed places in the cell. So the energy transfer in the cell does not have to be totally instantaneous like combustion would be, and it can be spent exactly where it needs to be spent. Yet, the production of ATP is in fact generated by an electron transfer, but indirectly. No, electrons are NOT transferred from organic matter to ATP. Yes, electrons are ultimately transferred from organic matter to an electron acceptor, which in the case of aerobic respiration is O2. But just like the generation of ATP is indirectly linked to the electron transfer, the transfer of electrons from organic matter to the ultimate electron acceptor is also indirect. A set of molecules called electron transfer molecules, called NAD+ and FAD are intermediate carrier of electrons and are the ones which power the proton pumps as represented in Figure 5.13 below. Figure 5.13: Electron transport chain occur within complexes I to IV at the innermembrane of a mitochondrion for eukaryots, or, of the cytoplasm for prokaryots. NADH directly powers complex I and there is enough energy from these electrons to also power complexes III and IV to pump protons in the intermembrane space. Complex II accepts electrons from FADH2 molecule (itself reduced by succinate - from the Krebs cycle - within complex II) and these electrons combine with those originally from NADH to power complexes III and IV. Coenzyme Q or ubiquinone is an intermediate between complexes I and III, and between II and III while cytochrome c is an intermediate between complexes III and IV. The flow of electrons within the membrane is illustrated by pink arrows After Fvasconcellos A great summary of how electrons power the proton pumps in provided in the video in Figure 5.14. In short, there are four protein complexes referred to as Complexes I to IV (Figure 5.13). These protein complexes are configured to release the electron energy to pump electrons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. The ubiquinone molecule, isoprenoid described in chapter 4 is referred to as coenzyme Q in the video. Figure 5.14: Proton pumps in action. Coenzyme Q corresponds to ubiquinone Obtained with permission from HarvardX The bottom line is that the electrons that were originally on organic matter have enough energy to power proton pumps, even after glycolysis and transport onto NAD and FAD. Proton pumping results into the chemiosmosis and the proton motive force that provides the mechanical force to synthesize ATP. 5.4.4 Electron transfer molecules that power the proton pumps The two main electron transfer molecules in the respiration process are called NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide; Figure 5.15) and FAD (flavine adenine dinucleotide; Figure 5.16). These two nucleotides have the ability to be reduced (= gain electrons) and oxidized (= lose electrons), and because they are mobile, to carry electrons from the cell (bacteria) or mitochondrion (eukaryot) cytoplasm to the proton pumps. Actually, FAD in this context seems to be embedded into complex II and is reduced as succinate is oxidized into fumarate into the citric acid cycle (Figure 5.13). Figure 5.15: Molecular formula of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) in both oxydized and reduced states Figure 5.16: Molecular formula of Flavine Adenine Dinucleotide (FAD) in both oxydized and reduced states Notice that reduction and oxidation of NAD+ and FAD are made possible and reversible thanks to the cyclic rings where nitrogen is involved, creating stabilizing resonance and pseudo-conjugation. 5.4.5 Transfer of electrons from the Organic Carbon to an electron acceptor So this answers the question of how the proton pumps are powered, but it is now time to look at the global fate of electrons: where do they come from and where do they end up? Actually, we already know the global answers to these questions: the electrons are stored unto the C, N, and S of organic molecules and they are eventually accepted by an electron acceptor; in the case of organotrophic aerobic respiration, O2 is the ultimate electron acceptor, and carbon atoms are the electron donors. Before there might be any confusion, in the aerobic respiration process that involves organic molecules as electron donors (we will see that inorganic molecules can also be electron donors), strangely enough, the only atom which donates electron is carbon while the nitrogen and sulfur atoms keep all their eight electrons. Specialized microbes, called lithotrophs, literally ‘feed on stone’, which means that their source of electron is from an inorganic molecule, have the ability to use ammonium, hydrogen sulfide, methane, but also reduced iron and manganese as electron donor (8 electrons available for ‘donation’) in their aerobic respiration chains (details in section 7). So all this to say that in aerobic respiration that involves organic matter, only the carbon atom donates its electrons. The organisms which use organic matter as electron donors are called organotrophs. We, as mammals and humans, are organotrophs. 5.4.6 Oxygen reduction and oxidative phosphorylation Let us start from the end of the process: the reduction of oxygen into H2O, as represented on Figure 5.13 above. As the NADH and FADH2 are powering proton pumps (which names include Complex I, III, and IV; see Figure 5.13), the electrons lose some of their energy and migrate within the phospholipid membrane from the Complex I to III and then IV, and, from complexes II to III, and then IV (Figure 5.14). Because of the involvement of many different proteins involved in this transport, this is referred to as the electron transfer chain. Because the NADH and the FADH2 molecules are oxidized (they have given up their electrons) enabling proton pumping, the whole process is referred to as oxidative phosphorylation. Within Complex IV (Figure 5.13), reaction (5.2) occurs: \\[\\begin{equation} O_2 + 4 e^- + 4 H^+ \\Rightarrow 2 H_2O \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] This is the place where the electrons are accepted!!! So now you know exactly where all this is happening! Is not that wonderful? So the electrons are accepted by O2 (remember on a molecule of O2, each oxygen atom only has 6 electrons for itself, so each can accept two more), and these electrons reduce oxygen into H2O. This has several consequences: the reduction of O2 also consumes 4 H+, which solves the necessity for an outlet for protons as they flow out of the inter-membrane space through the ATPase, which was the third condition to maintain a proton gradient the reduction of O2 obviously consumes electrons, which also provides an outlet for the electrons. In order words, if no electron acceptors are available, then the electrons at the proton pumps have no outlet, so the proton pumps are stalled, which in turn halts the maintaining of a proton gradient, which eventually stops the production of ATP. 5.4.7 Respiration electron flow schemes These last sections were necessary but we now need to connect them with some of the practical consequences that concern ecological engineering. The electron donors are the fuel for all microbial processes involved in the substrate of ‘treatment systems’. The byproduct of the loss of electrons originally stored on the electron donor will be a source of inorganic molecules that matter When the electron acceptor is O2, this results in an oxygen demand which may have consequences on the overall oxygen level and may lead to anaerobic conditions, where other electron acceptors come in play We try to take advantage of the anaerobic conditions to dissipate or strip excess nutrients, e.g. NO3- So we thought we could provide a nice concise summary of respiration to highlight the points that matter for environmental and microbial considerations in the form of respiration schemes, still maintaining some of the important drivers of the formation of ATP. In the first respiration scheme in Figure 5.17 below, the transfer of electrons is represented by the blue wavy line. Electrons are transferred from an electron donor to an electron acceptor. The consequences of the transfer are represented in thicker light blue arrows. The first consequence of the transfer of electrons is the powering of proton pumps, which in turn create a proton gradient in the inter-membrane space, which result into proton flow creating the proton motive force, which gives the necessary energy to catalyze the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP. The products of oxidation, reduction, and phosphorylation are represented in black arrows. Figure 5.17: Generic respiration scheme illustrating the flow of electrons from an electron donor to and electron acceptor, the by-products of the respective oxidation and reduction, and the consequences on proton gradients and flow, which ultimately help catalyse the formation of ATP The respiration scheme is obviously an oversimplified representation of the what happens as described above, but generally holds true. Some ATP are generated during glycolysis and in association with the Krebs cycle, but represent 4 out of a total of 38, or about 10% of the total. So it is probably fair to simplify things to represent the majority of the processes (here 90%). The beauty of this scheme is that it applies to just about all types of electron donors and acceptors. 5.4.8 Aerobic respiration schemes for organotrophs In the next scheme, we take the classic example of aerobic respiration, where glucose is considered as the electron donor, and O2 the electron acceptor. Figure 5.18: Aerobic respiration scheme illustrating the flow of electrons from glucose to O2, the by-products of the respective oxidation and reduction being CO2 and H2O, and H2O. The consequences of the transfer of electrons on proton pumps, gradients and flow, which ultimately help catalyse the formation of ATP, do not change from the generic respiration scheme above Using the generic carbohydrate CH2O as a source of electrons, it is possible to express the donation of electrons in equation (5.3) (redox half reaction): \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + H_2O \\rightarrow CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] Organisms which use organic molecules as electron donors are referred to as organotrophs, hence the title. We shall see later that some microorganisms are able to use inorganic molecules as their electron donors. In our case (Figure 5.18), the byproduct of glucose as the carbon atoms lose all their electrons becomes CO2 as show in equation (5.3). In turn, the electrons are accepted by O2 following equation (5.4) \\[\\begin{equation} O_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightarrow 4H_2O \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] The combination of donating electrons from glucose (equation (5.3)), or organic matter illustrated in Figure 5.19, combined with the accepting of these electrons by O2 (equation (5.4)), results in the combined overall summary of aerobic respiration: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + O_2 \\rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O \\tag{5.5} \\end{equation}\\] The third scheme (Figure 5.19), the generic term organic matter is used to show that in reality, not only glucose can be part of the electron transfer chain, but essentially all types of organic molecules, as represented in Figure 5.20. So the only difference with the previous scheme with glucose only, are the by-products of the catabolism of organic matter: CO2, NH4+, HS-, and PO43-. Figure 5.19: Aerobic respiration scheme illustrating the flow of electrons from organic matter to O2, the by-products of the oxidation of OM include ammonium, hydrogen sulfide and phosphate this time The important thing to notice here is that the N and S atoms, which in organic molecules possess 8 electrons for themselves, or are fully reduced, stay reduced as byproducts of respiration. This might appear odd as mentioned before, because there are electrons available for another oxidation to take place. Lithotroph micro-organisms are specialized in taking advantage of these available electrons, as we shall see later. The important message here is that you can see that respiration processes essentially breakdown large molecules into small inorganic ones, and that in the case of respiration for organotrophs, the only atom to lose its electrons is carbon. Figure 5.20: Oxidative phosphorylation of organic molecules of carbohydrates but of other molecular families as well. Figure obtained from Essential Cell Biology from Garland Science If we think about this apparent oddity, N and S are a lot more electronegative than C, so in the organotroph cell, it is a lot easier for oxygen to strip electrons from carbon than it is from N and S. It might be worth taking a hydraulic analogy: in a soil, pore water will tend to drain through the area of a soil that has the highest hydraulic conductivity, or use the path of least resistance, totally by-passing areas of lower hydraulic conductivity. Chemically, it is just a lot easier to obtain electrons and energy out of the reduced carbon, and a lot harder to obtain them from amine (-NH2) and thiol (-SH) radicals; this is why N and S stay in a reduced form as byproducts of organotrophic respiration. Again, several group of lithotrophs specifically target the electrons on ammonium and on Hydrogen sulfide, and use O2 as their electron acceptor. Section 5.4 was dedicated to the procuction of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. It is now time to look in more details at the glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, which produce ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation, and which serve as primers to the oxidative phosphorylation processes. Again, all three are involved in respiration that includes a cascading series of three suites of reactions/processes called: Glycolysis the Krebs or citric acid cycle, and the oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 5.6) 5.5 Glycolysis: an ancient way to produce ATP from glucose by substrate-level phosphorylation 5.5.1 Substrate-level phosphorylation Glycolysis consits, as its name indicates, in breaking glucose. This breaking is accompanied by a loss of 4 electrons, which are temporarily transferred onto the NAD+ electron transfer molecule, and, by the formation of a net 2 ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. Remember what we said in section 5.2: one of the keys to life and to movement of molecules, was the plethora of electrons that were contained around the three tetraedra of the tri-phosphate end of ATP? Because of that, the level of energy of electrons has to be higher to keep the phosphates bonded together, and, the tetraedra consequently are in constant movement relative to each other because of electrostatic repulsions (and this is why hydrolysis of this bond generates more stable products and releases energy). This is certainly true among phosphates, but that is certainly also true for phosphate tetraedra that would be bonded to C2 or C3 molecules where there would be quite a few electrons nearby, like in the carbonyl (-C=O) or double carbon bonds (-C=C-) of the enol (-C=COH-) group (Figure 5.21). Figure 5.21: Highly unstable bonds associated with phosphates in ATP, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate. It is the presence of π double bonds that create an excess of high energy electrons near the phosphate, creating the highly unstable bonds, which upon hydrolosis and combined with the phosphoryl group, allows for substrate level phosphorylation In reality there is a short list of functional groups where highly unstable bonds can be formed (and represented with a skwingly line in Table 5.1): diphosphoanydrides, acyl phosphates, enol phosphates, phosphoramidates, and thioesters. Most of them involve phosphate, and have this double bond very close to the phosphate group (Table 5.1). One does involve the thioester bond. In the thioester bond, the sulfur, having two lone pairs and having d orbitals also have high electron density, although not quite as high as in phosphate, and the energy release after hydrolysis the thioester bond is not quite that of other groups where phosphate is involved. Table 5.1: List of organic compounds hosting highly unstable bonds because of the high density of electrons packed together between mostly phosphate and a double bond. In the thioester bond, the sulfur, having two lone pairs and having d orbitals also have high electron density, although the energy released after hydrolysis of the thioester bond is not quite that of that of other groups where phosphate is involved Class Bond Examples Diphosphoanhydrides pyrophosphates, ADP, ATP Acyl phosphates 1,3-biphosphoglycerate, acetyl phosphate Enol phosphates phosphoenolpyruvate Phosphoramidates phosphocreatine, phosphoarginine Thioesters acetyl-coA, acyl-coA This would be almost anecdotal if the thioester unstable bond were not involved in essential metabolic processes. It does seem that the “thioester bond might be primeval in the development of life” (Duve 1995) or in other words might have preexisted ATP. ATP might have essentially replaced thioester bonds later, although not entirely, in the development of life because it yielded more energy. As evidence, De Duve (1995) states that: thioesters are obligatory intermediates in several key processes in which ATP is either used or regenerated. Thioesters are involved in the synthesis of all esters, including those found in complex lipids. They also participate in the synthesis of a number of other cellular components, including peptides, fatty acids, sterols, terpenes, porphyrins and others. In addition, thioesters are formed as key intermediates in several particularly ancient processes that result in the assembly of ATP. Going back to the primary objective of this section: substrate-level phosphorylation involves the phosphorylation of ADP (and GDP) into ATP (and GTP) using the chemical energy released from an accompanying reaction. The accompanying reaction often involves the hydrolysis of a phosphorylated compound where the phosphate released is recycled to phosphorylate ADP to ATP. This is in fact what happens during glycolysis (Figure 5.23): the phosphate attached to the glycerate and the pyruvate backbones are highly unstable bonds because of the presence of the double bonds in 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate (Figure 5.21 and 5.22). ADP can react with these two molecules, which provide both the phosphoryl groups and the energy necessary for the substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP (Figure 5.22). In reality, in the Krebs or citric acid cycle, GTP, i.e., Guanine TriPhosphate is substrate-level phosphorylated as well using the energy release after hydrolysis of the thioester bond. We shall see that GTP formed during the citric acid cycle serves for the substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP into ATP. Figure 5.22: ‘High energy bonds’, represented with the skwigly line, associated with phosphates in ATP, 1,3 Bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, molecules of the pay off phases of glycolysis. It is the presence of π double bonds that create an excess of high energy electrons near the phosphate, creating the high energy release after hydrolysis of the phosphate bond, which, combined with the phosphoryl group, allows for substrate level phosphorylation 5.5.2 Energy investment and energy pay off phases of glycolysis Now that we know what substrate-level phosphorylation is, it is time to summarize what glycolysis does and when substrate-level phosphorylation occurs. Glycolysis consists in breaking the molecule of glucose into two C3 molecules of pyruvate, thereby producing 2 molecules of ATP (Figure 5.6). The four electrons lost during this suite of reactions are transferred onto, or reduce, two NAD+ molecules, which in respiration are used to power the proton pumps. To break the C6 glucose molecule, the bond at the center of the molecule must be somehow ‘weakened’. An efficient way to do that is to create large electronegativity at both ends of the C6 molecule! And the moeity that packs a lot of electronegativity is phosphate. And what molecule has the energy and the potential to add phosphate moeities? ATP of course! So you read correctly: glycolysis to occur must first ‘invest’ two ATP molecules to add phosphate moieties at both ends of the glucose molecule (which technically becomes fructose 1,6-biphosphate; Figure 5.23). This phase is referred to as the energy investment phase of glycolysis. Once the original C6 molecule has been split into two C3 molecules (technically two glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate molecules; Figure 5.23), the energy invested can be caught back, and the four electrons and their energy lost during this breaking of glucose can be transferred, respectively, onto two NAD+ molecules and onto 4 ATP. This phase is referred to as the energy pay off phase. Reactions 1 to 5 in Figure 5.23 correspond to the energy investment phase where the C6 carbohydrate ends are phosphorylated by ATP. As the phosphorylated C6 carbohydrates are broken into two C3 carbohydrates, two carbon atoms are oxidized, i.e., lose two electrons each, which are transferred to the electron transfer molecule NAD+ (reaction 6 in Figure 5.23). The energy pay off phase corresponds to reactions 7 to 10 in Figure 5.23. The 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate (Figure 5.21) substrate-level phosphorylate ADP into ATP (Figure 5.26). Glysolysis can thus be summarized into \\[ Glucose + 2 \\space ATP + \\space 2\\space NAD^+ \\rightarrow 2 \\space pyruvates + \\space 2\\space (NADH + H^+) \\space + \\space 4 \\space ATP\\] The net production of ATP is thus 4 - 2 = 2 ATP produced during glycolysis, and 4 electrons transferred to NAD+ (during phase 6 in Figure 5.23), which also correspond to those written in green ‘explosion boxes’ in Figure 5.6. Figure 5.23: Glycolysis pathway energy investment phase (reactions 1-5), the electron transfer phase (reaction 6) to NAD+, and the energy pay off phase (reactions 7-10). Modified from opentextbc Energy wise, this is not a particularly efficient system to produce ATP. However, glycolysis is the only suite of reactions that exists throughout all the cells from the most ancient Archea to eukaryotic cells, and exists in all respiration and fermentation pathways. So although somewhat archaeic, glycolysis is the prerequisite for all other respiration processes. However, to proceed, the electrons transferred to NAD+ must be accepted somewhere else to ‘recycle’ the NAD so that it may accept electrons again during glycolysis. The 10 high energy electrons still stored on pyruvate at the end of glycolysis are, in the Krebs or citric acid cycle, also eventually transferred onto NAD and FAD electron transfer molecules, and serve to fuel the proton pumps. 5.5.3 Electrons fate and electron transfer molecules Electron transfer molecules such as NAD+ and FAD play the very important intermediate role of transporting highly energetic electrons from organic matter to electron acceptors, and while doing so power proton pumps. NADH and FADH2 in respiration are oxidized back while powering proton pumps because there is a demand for electrons by the exogenous electron acceptors (Figures 5.6, 5.13, and 5.14). But they are a bit like taxis which can only do their work of transporting people if they can pick up and deliver passengers: electron transfer molecules can ‘do their jobs’ if they can accept and deliver or donate their electrons afterwards. When they are fully reduced, they cannot accept additional electrons and must be oxidized before they can accept electrons again. Just like taxis that are full of people cannot take additional passengers, and can take passengers again only after they have brought them to their destination. In the presence of external or exogenous acceptors, oxidative phosphorylation can take place and the electrons are eventually accepted by electron acceptors, hence oxidizing NADH and FADH2 back to NAD+ and FAD. But in absence of exogenous electron acceptors, the NADH produced during glycolysis must too donate their electrons to allow the formation of the 2 ATP to go on. Endogenous molecules, namely organic molecules accept them, but at no energy gain: this is what happens during fermentation. (Figure 5.6). The bottom line is that, unless the electrons temporarily stored on the electron transfer molecules have an outlet, no ATP can be produced in cells. 5.6 The citric acid or Krebs cycle as an efficient way to transfer high energy electrons Between the glycolysis and the oxidative phosphorylation, lies the suite of reactions referred to as the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle. The primary function of the citric acid cycle is to extract the high energy electrons originally from the glucose molecule and transfer them at little energy loss to the electron transfer molecules NAD+ and FAD. By doing so, the carbon is released as CO2, as we now know quite well that this is the simplest form in which carbon is the stable electron-less molecular form in an aerobic environment (see Table 2.1). The electron transfer molecules release these electrons by powering the proton pumps of the innermembrane for bacteria, and innermembrane of mitochondria for eukaryots. Unlike glycolysis, the citric acid suite of reactions is cyclic, in that the last element is the primer for the incorporation of new radical groups into the cycle. 5.6.1 Oxidation of pyruvate as a preliminary step There is a little mismatch between the Krebs cycle and pyruvate. Indeed, the citric acid cycle is composed of a series of 9 molecules which derive from one another from a C6 molecule (citric acid; view it as a propan-2-ol, each carbon of which would have a carboxyl group) to a C4 molecule (oxaloacetate), with only one C5 form in the middle (Figure 5.26). At the same time, for every glucose molecule, glycolysis produces two molecules of pyruvate, i.e., C3 molecules. The incorporation of a pyrurate into the citric acid cycle should make a C7 molecule (C4 + C3) and not a C6 as citric acid… Indeed, it is not pyruvate that is incorporated into the citric acid cycle, but a pyruvate that has lost a CO2, i.e., an acetyl group. Prior to entering the citric acid cycle, pyruvate is oxidized and loses a Carbon atom in the form of CO2 during a reaction referred to as pyruvate decarboxylation and performed by an enzyme called pyruvate dehydrogenase and the coenzyme vitamin B1 (Figure `5.24). Figure 5.24: Pyruvate decarboxylation transferring two electrons to NAD+ and forming Acetyl-CoA. By akane700 This reaction is actually rather complex and the details are not necessary here. However, it is important to retain that: the two electrons lost during decarboxylation of pyruvate are transferred onto NAD+ to form NADH the removal of CO2 from pyruvate creates an acetyl radical the energy liberated during oxidation allows the formation of a thioester bond (unstable but which hydrolysis liberates energy; Table 5.1) between the acetyl group and the famous coenzyme A to form the acetyl-CoA molecule the energy liberated during the hydrolysis of the thioester bond of the acetyl-CoA allows the incorporation of the acetyl group (C2 molecule) onto the last molecule of the Krebs cycle (oxaloacetate, a C4 molecule; Figure 5.26) to form citrate (C6) pyruvate, rather than losing a carbon to enter the Krebs cycle, can also accept an extra carbon, thanks to the pyruvate carboxylase provided energy be spent by hydrolysis of an ATP, to yield an oxaloacetate (Figure 5.26) 5.6.2 Transfer of all electrons to NAD+ and FAD Counting the number of electrons, pyruvate stores a total of 10 electrons stored on the carbon atoms, and the acetyl radical has 8 (Figure 5.25) Figure 5.25: Lewis dot structure of pyruvate and acetyl radical group illustrating the electron allocation on carbon atoms: 10 electrons on pyruvate and 8 electrons on the acetyl radical So, the complete oxidation of the acetyl radical should yield 8 electrons, and the molecular byproduct of this complete oxidation should be two molecules of CO2. Looking at the citric acid cycle illustrated in Figure 5.26, one can see that along the cycle 3 molecules of NAD+ are reduced to NADH and that during the oxidation of succinate into fumarate, two electrons are transferred onto FAD to form FADH2 (happening within Complex 2 of the electron transfer chain), for a total of 8 electrons. And along the cycle, two CO2 molecules are liberated. Things add up! So after recapitulation, for each glucose molecule originally storing 24 electrons (Figure 2.8), 4 electrons are lost during glycolysis to NAD+, leaving 2×10=20 electrons on 2 molecules of pyruvate. The decarboxylation of pyruvate prior to entering the citric acid cycle involves the loss of 2 electrons, or 2×2=4 electrons per glucose molecule. The 2×8= 16 electrons left on the acetyl radical lose their electrons to NAD+ and FAD in the citric acid cycle. Things also add up for each glucose molecule. Organotrophic aerobic respiration thus consists in fully oxidizing glucose molecules (and organic carbon in general) to O2 producing CO2 as the carbon byproduct. This is exactly what happens when we breath: we inhale air containing 21% of O2 and 0.04% of CO2, and exhale air containing about 16% of O2 and 4% of CO2. Not all O2 is consumed because of small residence time in the lungs, but the CO2 concentration is multiplied by 2 orders of magnitude (×100). Figure 5.26: Krebs or citric acid cycle pathway. After Narayanese, CC BY-SA 3.0 Notice that there is no ATP directly produced inside the citric acid cycle, but only GTP via substrate-level phosphorylation. But GTP then substrate-level phosphorylate ADP to form ATP (Figure 5.25). In Figure 5.27 below which summarizes all the aerobic respiration pathways, you can see that most of the ATP is formed thanks to the proton flow, and that electron transfer molecules are involved in all steps.

We can summarize the respiration process again in that order: the goal of respiration is to transfer energy initially stored as high energy electrons on organic molecules to ATP, the energy currency of the cell The production of ATP itself has to come from a different source of energy than that liberated by ATP itself Most ATP are synthesized by oxidative phosphorylation of ADP by the ATP synthase, itself powered by a proton flow from the inter-membrane space to the cytoplasm space the proton flow is powered by a proton gradient between the inter-membrane space and the cytoplasm space This gradient is made possible thanks to a proton-tight compartment corresponding to the intermembrane space a supply of protons from the cytoplasm to the intermembrane space, fed by proton pumps an outlet for the protons flowing out and powering the ATPase (‘the proton mill’), which combined with the reduction of oxygen form water molecules The proton pumps are themselves powered by the oxidation of electron transfer molecules (NAD and FAD), which carry high energy electrons from the Krebs or citric cycle to the electron transfer chain The electron transfer molecules accept the electrons, or are reduced during glycolysis, before and during the Krebs cycle as organic carbon are oxidized or lose their electrons and release CO2 The other way to present respiration may be to say that: Energy rich electrons stored on organic molecules are transferred onto electron transfer molecules during glycolysis, before and during the Krebs cycle For oxidative phosphorylation of ATP, the high energy electrons thus transported power proton pumps to pump protons in the intermembrane space of the cell for unicellular organisms or of the mitochodria for eukaryotic cells These pumps feed a supply of protons to the intermembrane space which, because this space is proton-tight, and because protons outlets are limited to the ATP synthase, creates an accumulation of protons in this space The accumulation of protons creates a proton gradient between the intermembrane space and the cytoplasm, which generates a proton flow at designated ‘valves’ in the membrane The protons flow out the intermembrane through the ATP synthase, which can be approximated by proton canals, provide a proton motive force capable of mechanically turn the ATPase head which acts as a ‘proton mill’ The rotation of the proton mill catalyzes the phosphorylation of ADP into ATP The proton gradient is maintained possible because the protons flowing out of the inter-membrane space are combined with electrons reducing oxygen into water The electron flow is maintained thanks to the same oxygen reduction, which in turns allows electron transfer molecules to be oxidized so that then can take their ‘electron load’ again Overall respiration consists in transferring high energy electrons from organic molecules to oxygen (or other electron acceptor), and by doing so creating chemiosmosis or a proton gradient, which in turn is the main driver for the formation of most ATP in the cell Both summaries present the same story but have their own logic. Other important subtleties of respiration include: In the case organic molecules are the source of electrons, only the carbon atoms donate electrons, the amine and thiol radicals being eliminated as a by-product DO NOT donate their electrons in this respiration system. This is admittedly a bit weird as the the amine and thiol groups still have 8 electrons to donate each. 5.7 Fermentation or staying alive without exogenous electron acceptor ATP, the energy currency of the cell is necessary for life to exist and thrive. Again, it is the reversibility of \\[ATP \\rightarrow ADP + P_i\\] using mechanical energy (proton motive force) or substrate-level phosphorylation that makes this molecule so universal and essential for life of cells and organisms. In absence of exogenous electron acceptor, i.e., available through the environement, the electron transfer chain is shut down, and so is oxidative phosphorylation… So the only source of ATP left is glycolysis (only 10% of the ATP in normal respiration). But for glycolysis to keep functioning, the electrons transfered onto NAD+ must be accepted somewhere, otherwise glycolysis is stalled as well… This is where fermentation occurs: the electrons lost during glycolysis and transferred onto NAD+ are eventually accepted by endogenous electron acceptors, namely C2, C3, and C4 molecules. This section is still under construction In the next chapter, we will introduce all the respiration processes, aerobic and anaerobic, and performed by organotrophs and lithotrophs. References "],

The secret is that in an aerobic environment with the atoms of oxygen in the dioxygen molecule being so eager to capture electrons, the electrons can freely and will naturally flow from the organic molecules to oxygen. This electron transfer releases energy. We have seen that in the case of methane combustion, the electron transfer is direct, leading to the release of ephemeral heat and light, resulting in a large and sudden increase of entropy. But this type of energy release is just not sustainable for organisms which must find ways to minimize the energy release in the form of heat, and have a way to release the energy exactly where it is needed. It does need an intermediate and ubiquitous storage of energy. The secret is the pyrophosphate bond of the ATP molecule, which can temporarily store lots of energy without the involvment of direct electron transfer. The formation of the pyrophosphate bonds is thought to be mechanically induced by the rotation of the ATPase, itself powered by a proton flow maintained between compartments. In the end the electron transfer only indirectly leads to the formation of ATP, by powering the proton pumps. It is thus fascinating that the release of the energy chemically stored onto high energy electrons on organic molecules involves many small steps, which essentially prevent the direct transfer from the electron donor to the acceptor, which would lead to combustion… All of this works in the long run if somehow there is a source of organic molecules, otherwise with a finite amount of organic molecules, the respiration process would eventually deplete all organic molecules on earth. So the correlary to the energy release in respiration, is the capture and storage of energy. And this is where it is very useful to be on a planet close enough to its star such that receives enough but not too much energy. One of life’s secret has been to be able to capture this allochthonous source of energy, i.e., sunlight, and store it, and now you know in what form: store it in the form of high energy electrons onto organic molecules. This chapter provides enough of the details of photosynthesis processes that lead to the formation of carbohydrates. 6.1 Requirements to store energy on organic molecules 6.2 No need to reinvent the wheel for the production of ATP and the transfer of electrons Chapter still under construction "],

We took aerobic respiration as our model to determine that most of the ATP produced in the cell is principally due to a proton flow from the inter-membrane space to the cytoplasm, for microbial cells and within the mitochondria for eukaryotic cells (Figure 5.27). The respiration schemes provide a very handy method to summarize the important drivers and consequences of respiration: the electron donors, the electron acceptors, and the byproducts of both oxidation and reduction. In this chapter we are going to explore the diversity of electron donors and acceptors present in nature, many of which represent important processes for ecological engineering. As a first step, we will use a theoretical wetland soil to explore some of the variety of respiration schemes. We will take advantage of these processes at play in wetland soils to explore the consequences on concentration gradients and movement of molecules of importance in environmental and ecological engineering. We will then introduce additional ways microbes have found to obtain their energy, and summarize the whole using the different prefixes for the word ‘trophs’. 7.1 The theoretical vertical sequence of respiratory processes in wetland soils For this we will use a theoretical wetland soil to illustrate our point. Such theoretical soil has ‘enough’ organic matter content for microbial respiration to take place throughout its profile, ‘enough’ of other sand, silt, and clay and all the minerals that accompany them, including iron and manganese oxides. Let us assume that this theoretical soil, is sufficiently moist and aerated for microbial aerobic respiration to take place throughout the soil profile. Let us then assume that this soil is suddenly flooded, and let us explore the consequences of this. Respiratory processes are going to occur on a temporal sequence, which in fact will be mirrored by a vertical sequence of processes in the wetland sediment. 7.2 An aerobic layer near the soil-water interface At first, all micro-organisms are going to use all the oxygen that might be present in the pore space. But because pore space is now getting filled with water, it is possible that the amount of oxygen available for microorganisms might change. And yes, indeed, water does not have nearly the capacity to provide oxygen as air does for several reasons: at 15°C in water there are about 10 mg of O2 in one liter of water. Comparatively, in one liter of air, there is about 300 mg of O2, or 30 times more. How does one calculate this? At standard conditions, 1 liter of air at 21% oxygen possesses 0.21 L of oxygen. Since for these conditions, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L, simply divide 0.21/22.4, to arrive at 0.0094 moles of oxygen. Then the mass of oxygen in 1 liter of air is 0.0094×32 g/mole = 300 mg. the diffusivity (which quantifies the ability of elements to move about) of O2 in air is 0.176 cm²/s while that of O2 in water is 2.10×10−5 cm²/s, or more than 8,000 times smaller (Wikipedia contributors 2017) In other words, it is good to remember that the amount of oxygen available in water compared to air is about 30 less, and that oxygen in water moves more than 8,000 slower in water than in air. So, one can clearly see that the potential supply of oxygen from flooded porewater is thus a lot more limited than in aerated pore space. Now, where is the potential source for supply of oxygen for our recently flooded soil? The answer is the atmosphere. For a real flooded wetland soil, another source of O2 might be photosynthesis from algae and aquatic vegetation during the day. But in all cases, most of the oxygen needed for microbial aerobic respiration of our new flooded soil will have to travel the distance corresponding to the thickness of the water column, and, the linear distance within the porous medium of the soil, which can be quite tortuous. This property of the soil/sediment has been factored in by researchers and been called tortuosity. In summary, the supply of oxygen to bacteria in a flooded soil is limited because of four factors: there is about 30 times less O2 in water than there is in the same volume of air the O2 diffusive transport capacity in water is about 8,000 times smaller than that in air O2 has to travel from the atmosphere to the soil through the thickness of the water column, and travel through the tortuous path of the soil porous medium In addition to these four rules, which apply to all aquatic systems, the velocity of water matters very much in the reaeration process, which corresponds to factor 1 above: reaeration is much higher for streams than for stagnant waters (see this chapter). In other words, the stagnant water above our flooded wetland soil example, is another factor, compared to streams, which further limits the supply of oxygen to the aerobic bacteria in the flooded soil. This will be developed at length in the thermochemistry part of the class. Not surprisingly, this supply is just too limited compared to the demand. As a result, most of our recently flooded soil bacteria consumes all the O2 and the only part of the sediment that might have a little bit of oxygen is the area at the soil-water interface. This is what it illustrated in Figure 7.1 below. Figure 7.1: Animation summarizing the formation of aerobic and anaerobic layers of a theoretical flooded wetland soil due to the imbalance between bacterial respiratory oxygen demand and oxygen supply through the water column Because the O2 demand exceeds the O2 supply from the atmosphere and the water column, an O2 concentration gradient forms from the soil-water interface down. This concentration gradient, in turn, drives a downward movement of oxygen from the water column into the sediment down to the depth where there is no more concentration gradient. This depth defines the beginning of the anaerobic zone of the sediment, and above, the aerobic layer of the sediment. 7.3 Respiration in the anaerobic zone of the soil What happens to all the microbes in the anaerobic zone of the sediment? Certainly the exclusively aerobic microbes just do not survive, but most bacteria are facultative aerobs. In other words, they can switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration. Let us state this again: in the anaerobic zone of the sediment, only unicellular microorganisms are able to survive and have had to adapt their respiration to still be able to produce ATP for their metabolism, but using electron acceptors other than O2. It turns out that thermodynamics dictate that not all electron acceptors can generate the same amount of energy when they strip electrons from their electron donors. As a result, one can classify electron acceptors in decreasing order from the most to the least oxidizing, and the list of preferred electron acceptors goes as such: nitrate or NO3- Manganese oxide (MnO2) or Mn IV Iron oxides/hydroxyde or Fe III sulfate or SO42- Carbon dioxide or CO2 Although very different microbes are involved at the different stages, the apparent demand for electron acceptor, in our theoretical wetland soil, can be described as a temporal sequence of events: oxygen is the preferred electron acceptor; when O2 is all used, NO3- will be used as the preferred electron acceptor; when all the NO3- is used, the next most powerful electron acceptor is MnO2 (also referred to Mn IV; IV corresponds to its oxidation state), which is present in a solid or mineral form in soils; when all the MnO2 is used, then iron oxide or hydroxyde, which are also in the solid phase (also referred to Fe III, III corresponds to its oxidation state) will be used as the preferred electron acceptor; when all the Fe is used, then SO42- is used as the next preferred electron acceptor, and then when finally all the other electron acceptors have been all used, CO2 can be the ultimate electron acceptor…! Finally, to this temporal sequence corresponds a theoretical spatial sequence or layers where each of the electron acceptor essentially defines a soil layer, with the layers organized with depth from the most to the least oxidizing electron acceptor as represented in Figure 7.2 Figure 7.2: Theoretical spatial layering of wetland soils corresponding to the electron acceptor available, not too long after flooding. In each layer, the oxidizing and the reduced forms are illustrated as oxidizing/reduced. Not to scale It is now time to present the respiration processes in each of the redox layer. 7.4 A denitrification layer below the aerobic layer The next most powerful or oxidizing electron acceptor after O2 is NO3-. We have seen in the previous chapters that the N atom in nitrate has zero electron for itself, hence its ability to accept electrons. Just like for aerobic respiration, nitrate reduction just does not happen on its own. Facultative anaerobic bacteria called denitrifiers take advantage of the electrons available on organic matter and of nitrate to accept them to generate their energy. The denitrification of this theoretical wetland soil is referred to as heterotrophic denitrification because the source of carbon for these denitrifiers is also the source of electron, as OM is the source of both. The autolithotrophic denitrifiers, which use pyrite FeS2 as their source of electrons, are presented later in this chapter. There are two possible byproducts of nitrate reduction: N2, which is the inert gas that makes 78% of our atmosphere, and N2O, which is a potent greenhouse gas. The byproduct of the oxidation of OM are the same as the ones in aerobic heterotrophic respiration, i.e., CO2, NH4+, HS-, and PO43-. Figure 7.3: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic denitrification In reality, denitrification involves not a direct reduction of nitrate into N2 or N2O, but rather a sequence of reductions, summarized in equation (7.1), where nitrite, nitrogen monoxide, and nitrous oxides are intermediate products: \\[\\begin{equation} NO_3^- \\rightarrow NO_2^- \\rightarrow NO \\rightarrow N_2O \\rightarrow N_2 \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] Nitrous oxide is thus evidence of an incomplete denitrification. Because denitrification currently is the one mechanism, which removes nitrogen from the aqueous phase as gaseous byproduct, it currently ranks as the most effective ways to treat excess nitrogen in water. Entire research programs are dedicated to the development of methods and treatment systems to optimize this process. One of the active research areas is about finding ways to have denitrification go all the way to the N2 stage to minimize the production of N2O. Because this is a reduction process, and because nitrate is not assimilated in the denitrifier cells, a very short and good definition of denitrification is the microbially mediated dissimilatory reduction of nitrate into dinitrogen. The nitrogen atoms in the N2 molecule have 5 electrons for themselves. For complete denitrification, this means that the nitrogen atom has gained 5 electrons from NO3- to N~2. We will see in this chapter that it is possible to numerically show this in what is referred to as redox half reactions. A more complete and more descriptive definition of denitrification is Denitrification refers to the dissimilatory reduction, by essentially aerobic bacteria, of one or both of the ionic nitrogen oxides (nitrate, NO3-, and nitrite, NO2-) to the gaseous oxides (nitric oxide, NO, and nitrous oxide, N20), which may themselves be further reduced to dinitrogen (N2). The nitrogen oxides act as terminal electron acceptors in the absence of oxygen. The gaseous nitrogen species are major products of these reductive processes (Knowles 1982). The details of the electron transfer near the denitrifiers inner membrane are actually different (Figure 7.4) than those of aerobic respiration as illustrated in Figure ?? in this chapter. More proteins are involved, which descriptions are provided in Figure 7.4. The details of the denitrification of the electron transfer chain are beyond the purpose of this book. However, it is important to recognize that the electrons, originally stored on organic molecules, are brought to the membrane on the cytoplasm side by the electron transfer molecule NADH, just as is the case for aerobic respiration. It is also important to see that protons are pumped from the cytoplasm to the periplasm by ‘proton pumps’ such as cytochromes, and nitrate reductase powered by ubiquinone. Although the ATPase is not illustrated in Figure 7.4, the proton gradient formed in the periplasm does generate the proton motive force for the synthesis of ATP. In the end the electron transfer scheme of denitrication illustrated in Figure 7.3 holds, and sufficies for our purpose. Figure 7.4: Summary of Electron Transfer Chain for heterotrophic denitrification (after Su et al. (2015)). NAR: Nitrate reductase; NIR: nitrite reductase; NOR: nitric oxide reductace; N2OR: nitrous oxide reductase; UQ: ubiquinol; Fe-S: iron-sulfur protein; Cyt b, Cyt c: cytochrome b and c Denitrification is thought to be inhibited by the presence of oxygen, and thus only occurs in our theoretical wetland soil, below the aerobic layer. However, denitrification only occurs if there is nitrate present as electron acceptor. Therefore, for denitrification to proceed, there must be a supply of nitrate that can compensate the demand due to denitrification. The only place from where nitrate can be supplied, is the water column, and, possibly, the aerobic layer of the sediment where nitrification can take place, as we shall see later. Following the same analysis as that of aerobic respiration, the demand for nitrate creates a downward flux of nitrate from the water column down. Because of the transport distance for nitrate from the water column and through the aerobic layer of the sediment, the supply tends to be lower than the demand. This suggests that at one point in depth there will be no more nitrate as they are consumed faster than they can diffuse downward. Nitrates thus diffuse through layer 1, and both diffuse and are consumed as electron acceptors in layer 2 in Figure 7.2. Again, because the demand exceeds the supply, nitrates cannot move further down than the bottom of layer 2. Denitrification is thus theoretically restricted to layer 2. 7.5 Manganese and Iron oxides reductions Below the denitrification layer, microbes have to find new electron acceptors for their respiration. After O2, which is a gas, NO3-, which is a dissolved anion, the next elements which serve as electron acceptors are solids: Manganese and Iron oxides. They will serve as electron acceptors, only if soil minerals containing Mn and Fe oxides are present. In our theoretical wetland soil, the assumption is that these oxides are present. In layer 3 (Figure 7.2), MnO2 serve as the electron acceptor. In the MnO2 minerals, the manganese is in the Mn (IV) form, and can accept up to 2 e- to become the mobile Mn2+ cation. The quantitative details of the transfer of electrons are given in in this chapter. Overall the Manganese reduction respiration scheme is illustrated in Figure 7.5. Figure 7.5: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic Manganese oxide reduction While the electron donor is immobile, the reduction of MnO2 produces Mn2+ ions, which are dissolved, mobile in water, and can diffuse following concentration gradients. In our original hypothesis of the sudden flooding of the wetland soil, MnO2 oxides would be reduced from layer 3 down. The Mn2+ ions produced in these layers, and the lack of Mn2+ ions in layers 1 and 2, would create a concentration gradient, which would generate an upward flux of Mn2+, this time, from layers 3 to 6 into layers 2 and 1. The fate of Mn2+ ions as they reach the aerobic layer is discussed below. The global significance of managenese reduction to carbon oxidation in aquatic sediments seems to be rather low (reviewed in Thamdrup 2000), and less than 10% of total benthic mineralization. The contribution of organotrophic Mn reduction is limited by the low Mn content with depletion of Mn oxides within the upper 1-2 cm of most sediments and by slow reaction kenetics relative to the competing inorganic reduction. In contrast to Mn, Fe reduction contributes significantly to carbon oxidation in many sediments (Thamdrup 2000). After the MnO2 oxides are reduced, the iron oxides and hydroxide minerals will similarly serve as electron donors following the general equation (??), and respiration scheme illustrated in Figure 7.6. The reduction of an iron hydroxide Fe(OH)3 has been added to show that in reality, Fe3+ never exists as such, but almost always as iron oxides or hydroxides. Many forms of iron oxides exist in soils, hence the choice of choosing iron hydroxide Fe(OH)3 in equation (??). Fe3+, Fe(OH)3, and other iron oxides are referred to as ferric iron or Fe(III), because their oxidation state is 3. Ferric iron generally has an orange rusty color. As Fe3+ is oxidized into Fe2+, it gains one electron. Figure 7.6: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic Iron oxide reduction The electron transfer chain for manganese has not been researched as much as that of Fe, although the latter still holds many unknowns. Many different proteins are involved, and may vary depending on the organisms. In a recent review, Bird et al. (2011) illustrate two identified pathways. The first one for Geobacter sulfurreducens (Figure 7.7) involves a suite of proteins referred to as Omp or Omc. The energy yield of the electron transfer seems rather low however. The extracellular location of the electron acceptor (Fe III) is energetically costly, particularly because the proton gradient between the periplasm and the cytoplasm is limited by the absence of proton consumption in the cytoplasm (as is the case for aerobic respiration when the electrons are accepted in the cytoplasm with the consumption of a proton along with it). Using any external electron acceptor thus costs the cell one proton per electron transferred. The second reason for low efficiency is that the electron transport chain is short. In the current model of electron transfer to Fe(III), no energy is harvested after the electrons reach the periplasm. The amount of energy extracted from the electron transport chain therefore depends not on the potential difference (DE) between NADH and the final acceptor, but on the DE between NADH and the periplasmic acceptor. […] s. It therefore seems that Geobacter has adapted to use low-potential substrates [e.g. Fe(III) minerals] rather than maintaining an electron transport chain that would allow it to extract greater energy from higher potential acceptors(Figure 7.7; Bird, Bonnefoy, and Newman (2011)). Figure 7.7: (a) Electron tranfer chain for the organotrophic reduction of ferric iron (Fe III).

Abbreviations: NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; cit, citrate.scheme for heterotrophic Iron oxide reduction. from (Bird, Bonnefoy, and Newman 2011) In their second illustration, Bird et al. (2011) show that Shewanella oneidensis does not use proton gradients and the ATPase to produce ATP, but rather uses substrate level phosphorylation to gain energy when reducing Fe(III). The hypothesis is that the oxidation of lactate to acetate is sufficient to produce ATP, and this substrate level phosphorylation can go on at the electron donated to NADH end up on Fe (III) (Figure 7.8). Figure 7.8: (a) Electron tranfer chain for the organotrophic reduction of ferric iron (Fe III) in Shewanella. MtrC and OmcA are thought to be donors to Fe(III). Whether they interact directly with solid Fe(III), chelated Fe(III), electron shuttles such as flavins, or all three is unclear. ATP generation takes place via substrate level phosphorylation.

Blue arrows denote the aerobic path electrons take to O2, red arrows denote the path to Fe(III), and yellow bars denote potential ranges.

Similarly to Mn2+ ions, Fe2+ ions, or ferrous iron, or Fe(II) is a dissolved iron which is mobile in water, and can diffuse following concentration gradients. For the same reasons explained above for Mn2+, an upward concentration gradient between zones 4 to 6 and layers 3 to 1 is going to appear and the Fe2+ ions will tend to diffuse upward through layers 3 and 2. The fate of Fe2+ ions as they reach the aerobic layer is discussed below. This vertical spatial sequence of layers 3 and 4 presented here probably only applies not too long after the theoretical wetland soil has been flooded. Indeed, over the long periods, the supply of ferric iron and manganese oxides will run out, as the only supply is in immobile mineral forms. So over long periods, layers 3 and 4 do not exist. Is the case of a net downward water infiltration, the Fe2+ and Mn2+ ions diffuse upward all the way into the aerobic layer, and accumulate there for reasons illustrated below. In the more likely case of small but real net downward flux of water, the dissolved ions will leach out of the soil profile. The consequences are that poorly drained soils then to leach out their iron and manganese, which is referred to as iron and manganese depletion. This is the reason for the grey color of hydric soils (Figure 7.9). Figure 7.9: Example of pale bluish gray redox depletions. Note the faint rusty orange concentration distributed throughout the soil matrix.

As we have seen before, the sulfur atom on SO42- has zero electrons for itself and it therefore can accept electrons following redox half-reaction equation (??). Sulfate reducing bacteria reduce sulfate into sulfide (S2-) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), i.e., that the sulfur atom has gained 8 electrons. The respiration scheme below (Figure 7.10) suggests that Organic matter is generally the electron donor. Figure 7.10: Respiration scheme for heterotrophic sulfate reduction Recent reviews (Pereira et al. 2011; Barton, Fardeau, and Fauque 2014), suggest that more than one hundred compounds including H2, sugars, pyruvate, amino acids, mono- (lactate) and dicarboxylic acids (acetate), alcohols, NAD(P)H, and aromatic compounds are potential electron donors for Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB). The presence of H2, formate, and acetate in the list of potential donors is symptomatic of the low level of redox potential, as these are often associated with fermentation processes. There seems to be a large variety of electron transfer chains depending on the exact SRB, involving many additional enzymes and proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane (Figure 7.11). In the end, however, ATP is still largely produced following the proton motive force at the ATPase thanks to proton gradients maintained by proton pumps. Figure 7.11: Summary of all identifed electron transfers in Sulfate Reducing Bacteria, as reviewed in (Pereira et al. 2011). Observe the reduction of SO42- to S2- in the left corner. Observe the ATP synthase to the right, and many sorts of proton pumps. Also observe several of the electron donors listed in the previous paragraphs. The exhaustive list of the abbreviations and correspondance can be found in (Pereira et al. 2011). Typical concentrations of sulfate in ground- and stream waters are between 1 and 10 mg SO42-/L. In our theoretical wetland soil profile, sulfate that might be originally present in the porewater will be reduced in layers 5 and 6 of Figure 7.2. For the same reasons invoked for oxygen and nitrate, the potential source of supply for sulfate for the sulfate reducing layer is all the sulfate that might be present in the layers above and the water column. The demand for sulfate in layer 5 will create a downward concentration gradient which will generate a downward diffusive movement of sulfate down to layer 5. And again, because of all the diffusion distance, the supply of SO42- is limited and does not match the demand. The imbalance between the sulfate supply and demand will limit the diffusion of sulfate to the bottom of layer 5, below which there will be no more sulfate. 7.7 The methanogenesis oddity The last redox reactions to take place at the bottom of our theoretical wetland soil uses CO2 as the electron acceptor. Interestingly, the generic organic matter is no longer the electron donor, but is replaced by two byproducts of fermentation processes: H2 and acetic acid CH3COOH as illustrated in Figure 7.12. Figure 7.12: Respiration scheme for the heterotrophic Carbon dioxide reduction or methanogenesis Because of the source of the electron donors, methanogens have to be physically located close to bacteria which metabolism is based on fermentation. In reality, in many cases “microbes interact via syntrophic associations, in which the metabolic by-products of one species serve as nutrients for another” (Hamilton, Calixto Contreras, and Reed 2015). And this is not only a property of methanogens (see below). The electron transfer chain of the methanogen bacterium Methanospirillum hungatei has been nicely illustrated by (Hamilton, Calixto Contreras, and Reed 2015) and is represented in Figure 7.13. Notice that ATP is, here again, synthesized by the proton motive force thanks to the proton gradient created by inverse flow of Na+. The latter is created thanks to sodium pumps powered by the oxidation of H2 (bottom right). The electrons lost from H2 are accepted onto CO2, which acts as the substrate, and the reduced carbon then becomes CH4, which is excreted out of the cell. Figure 7.13: Summary of the Electron Transfer Chain for the methanogen bacterium Methanospirillum hungatei, which uses H2 as its electron donor. The exhaustive list of the abbreviations and correspondance can be found in supplementary information of (Hamilton, Calixto Contreras, and Reed 2015) 7.8 Fermentation in wetland and stream sediment In reality, the redox chain presented above and in most textbooks avoids several important additional electron transfer mechanisms, because the latter tend to ‘muddy the water’ a bit on the otherwise clear theoretical description. The first of these is fermentation. In the previous chapter, we saw that the whole respiration process starts with glycolysis, which produces pyruvate The fermentation products are beyond the scope of this class so, we will not come back to that, but it is important to recognize that H2 and CH3COOH can donate electrons as shown in these half-reactions: 7.9 First summary on the electron acceptor chain in wetland soils except for methanogenesis, organic matter always serves, for organotrophs, as the electron donor. Moreover, it is exclusively the Carbon of the OM which provides the electrons. as a result, the byproducts of the oxidation of the OM when the organic carbons lose their electrons are always the same: CO2, NH4+, H2S/HS-, and PO43- (but for methanogenesis). This means that at one point, all of these four (five if one counts both H2S and HS-, their exact proportion depends on pH, see details in the glossary) molecules will accumulate where they are produced unless they are used by another process To the contrary, the byproducts of the reduction of the electron acceptors are variable and depend on the electron acceptor. In the case of incomplete denitrification, and in the case of methanogenesis, N2O and CH4 are significant greenhouse gases. 7.10 Supply and demand of electron acceptors and of the byproducts of Organic Matter oxidation Now that we have established the reduction processes of the different electron acceptors at play, let us look at the consequences of the demands and the supplies associated with the respiratory processes. 7.10.1 Demands drive downward fluxes of dioxygen, nitrate and sulfate In the Figure 7.14 below, the general directions of the fluxes of electrons acceptors and byproducts of respiration are illustrated for our theoretical wetland soil. The processes taken together is sometimes referred to as soil or sediment diagenesis and all the processes in there are then collectively referred to as diagenetic processes. Figure 7.14: Diffusion fluxes of electron acceptors and all other soil diagenesis processes of a theoretical layered wetland soil The demands for dioxygen, nitrate, and sulfate in their respective layers, lower their concentrations compared to the overlying water and layers, hence the formation of concentration gradients, which then drive downward diffusive fluxes of these electron acceptors to their respective layers. These fluxes are represented as downward arrows in Figure 7.14. Now, it is the imbalance between the supply from above and the demand from below, that explain why the downward diffusion does not go beyond the bottom of the respective layers 1, 2, and 5 in Figure 7.14. The limitation of supply has been described for dioxygen in section 7.2. The diffusivity, distance, and tortuosity of the soil pores also apply for nitrate and sulfate, and explain why the demand is generally not met by the supply. 7.10.2 Supply of byproducts of organic matter oxidation For every respiration process described above (except for methanogenesis), the byproducts are: CO2, NH4+, H2S/HS-, and PO43-. This suggests that in every single layer, there is a supply of all for of these byproducts. Inevitably, this will create an upward concentration gradient, which will then be followed by an upward flux of these four molecules in the sediment. Phosphate will thus dissolve upward, at least until it reaches the aerobic layer. There it might encounter soil mineral oxides where it might bind, as we shall see in future chapters, hence the tips of the arrows not reaching the soil-water interface. However, it is possible that, if the aerobic layer is very thin and the mineral oxides are scarce in this thin layer, phosphates may diffuse all the way into the water column, hence the dotted arrow. 7.10.3 Nitrification Similarly, because of ammonium production in all the layers, but that of methanogenesis, ammonium will diffuse upward, until it reaches the aerobic layer. Remember that the nitrogen atom on the ammonium carries 8 electrons for itself, so it potentially carries a lot of energy. And yes, you guessed right, microbes called nitrifiers take advantage of these electrons and use ammonium as their electron donors, and use O2 as their electron acceptor. Because the electron donor this time is not an organic molecule, nitrifiers are called lithotrophs. Nitrification is represented in Figure 7.14 as the horizontal white arrow to the left. The nitrification respiration schemes is summarized in Figure 7.15. Figure 7.15: Respiration scheme for nitrification Depending on the thickness of the aerobic layer and the availability of dioxygen, all or only a portion of the ammonium may get nitrified as ammonium moves upward, hence the dotted arrow going all the way to the water column. As nitrate is now produced in the aerobic layer of the soil, then the concentration gradient may sway upward or remain downward, depending on the nitrate concentration in the water column, hence the upward nitrate dotted arrow in Figure 7.14. You may also notice that a dotted white arrow pointing the left has been added to illustrate nitrification which tends to readily occur in the water column, often thanks to nitrifiers attached at the soil-water interface. In reality nitrification involves two stages: the oxidation of ammonium into nitrite, performed by ammonium oxidizing bacteria, of which two important genera are Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococcus, and then the oxidation of nitrite into nitrate, performed by Nitrobacter and Nitrospira bacteria (Equation (7.2)). But as far as we are concerned, both steps tend to occur almost simultaneously, and nitrite is thermodynamically unstable, and as a result very little tends to accumulate, either in soil or sediment. \\[\\begin{equation} NH_4^+ \\rightarrow NO_2^- \\rightarrow NO_3^- \\tag{7.2} \\end{equation}\\] Work in progress Denitrification chain image here. By Uswbios - https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=24910639 7.10.4 Gas bubble formation Among the last two OM oxidation byproducts, CO2 and H2S are gases. We saw earlier, that in reality the balance between H2S and HS- depends on the pH. In rather organic soils, which most treatment wetland soils are, the pH tends to be rather acidic, often below 6.5. So it is fair to represent the H2S/HS- couple as H2S rather than HS- (see H2S/HS- Figure), hence the choice of H2S in Figure 7.14 and the use of H2S below. So in the end, if the summation of partial pressure of these and all other dissolved gases exceeds 1 atm + the hydraulic head, gas bubble will form and migrate upward. But because of surface tension forces, gas bubbles tend to get rather easily trapped in wetland soils and sediment. Hence the release of wetland gases when somebody or something disturbs the sediment, as we have seen in lab. To these two gases, one should add the production of CH4 in the methanogenesis layer, which will readily ‘join’ the gas bubbles and the ride with them. The dissolved fraction will also tend to move upward because of the concentration gradient. Interestingly, methane does not oxidized very well in normal aerobic conditions of wetland soils, and will therefore tend to diffuse all the way up to the water column as illustrated in Figure 7.14. Because of the demand for CO2 in the methanogenesis layer, downward arrows have been added for layers 4 and 5 in Figure 7.14. The downward diffusion would only apply for the dissolved CO2 as the gaseous form would obviously tend to move upward. 7.10.5 Oxidation of upward moving reduced sulfur Similarly to ammonium, and although a good proportion of H2S will end up in the gas phase, a still significant amount will stay in solution and will diffuse upward until it reaches the aerobic layer. Very similarly to ammonium, H2S still carries 8 electrons, which can be used for respiration provided that a strong enough oxidizer be present. In the aerobic layer of the sediment, H2S will be oxidized back into sulfate following the respiration scheme in Figure 7.16 Figure 7.16: Respiration scheme for hydrogen sulfide oxidation The bacteria taking advantage of the electrons on sulfur of H2S are called sulfur oxidizing bacteria. There are different from the sulfur reducing bacteria which use OM as their electron donors, and sulfate as their electron acceptors. The oxidation of H2S has been summarized by the white horizontal arrow in both the aerobic layer of the soil and the water column. Sulfate produced can then diffuse back downward to layer 5 in Figure 7.14. 7.10.6 Oxidation of upward moving Mn2+ and Fe2+ The last direct reduction byproducts of respiration processes include Mn2+ and Fe2+. Because they are being produced in layers 3 and below, an upward concentration gradient will be created, followed by an upward movement of Mn2+ and Fe2+. In Figure 7.14, both of them have been represented as starting to move up from layers 4. In all logic, Mn2+ and Fe2 should start moving upward as low as layer 6 because our original hypothesis was that soil was suddenly flooded, so in the temporal sequence of electron acceptors, before sulfate carbon dioxide reduction conditions would prevail in Layers 5 and 6, respectively, the Mn and Fe oxides will serve as electron acceptors, and Mn2+ and Fe2+ will then be produced. The more important fact is the fate of both Mn2+ and Fe2+ as they reach the aerobic layer. Because they are both reduced, they potentially have one electron to give, and yes, some bacteria have specialized in the ability to oxidize these ions. These bacteria are referred to as manganese and iron oxidizing bacteria. The respiration scheme corresponding to iron oxidation is illustrated in Figure 7.17 below. Figure 7.17: Respiration scheme for iron oxidation As both Mn2+ and Fe2+ get oxidized in the aerobic layer of the sediment, they form Mn and Fe oxides, which are solids and precipitates with the other soil minerals, hence the underlying and downward pointing arrows under the MnO2 and Fe3+ in Figure 7.14. The precipitation of iron oxides or hydroxides can be quite visually spectacular sometimes as reduced groundwater seeps out into the open. Iron can get very quickly oxidized and form rusty biofilms. Figure 7.18: Picture of an ‘iron seep’ in Goldsboro, NC, as reduced groundwater gets oxidized in contact with air 7.10.7 Moving of Dissolved Organic Carbon The last but not least of the processes at play in diagenesis is the formation and diffusion of Dissolved Organic Carbon in poorly or anoxic soils. This is the subject of a future chapter. This concludes this long chapter on the importance respiration processes occurring in wetland soils. References "],

The concentration of any constituent in water is determined by the dynamic equilibrium between supply and demand rates. The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) does not escape this simple rule. 9.1.1 The supply and demand of O2 in water The equilibrium between atmospheric O2 and that in the aqueous phase is discussed in details in this chapter. At this point, it is only important to understand that the activities, used in the chemistry sense here, are the same for elements in different phases at equilibrium. As a result, at equilibrium, there is O2 dissolved in water and the amount dissolved depends, in conditions where there is no demand, mainly on the temperature and on the velocity of water. The colder the water, the higher the concentrations, and the warmer the water, the smaller the concentrations. For example, at 5°C one can calculate that the equilibrium concentration is 12.8 mg/L, while at 20°C, it is 9.2 mg/L. We will see in this chapter that the reaeration of water, i.e., the kinetics at which O2 can dissolved into water depends on its turbulence: at low velocity, the reaeration is low, and at high velocity it is high. Additionally, the rate of supply of O2 to water may be affected by photosynthesis, which creates an endogenous additional source. The demand of oxygen in water comes from all aerobic respiratory processes existing in the water column itself (e.g., mineralization, nitrification, etc.) plus those existing in the bottom substrate. The final DO concentration results from the equilibrium between the supply and demand rates. When the potential for supply is much higher (e.g., swift cold stream) than the potential for demand, the DO concentrations are high (e.g., &gt; 6 mg/L). To the contrary, when the potential for supply is low (e.g., stagnant warm wetland water) and the potential for demand high (e.g., the same warm organic rich wetland), the DO concentrations will equilibrate at low concentrations (e.g., &lt; 2 mg/L). In the end, the level of concentration of DO, does determine the level of activity of aerobic respiratory processes in streams, which has consequences on the concentration levels of important inorganic and organic elements. 9.2 Level of nutrient concentrations in natural undisturbed streams This chapter is still under construction "],

An acid necessarily contains an atom of hydrogen. The two forms exchanging a proton a referred to as conjugate acid and base. Technically, a proton or hydrogen ion cannot exist unhydrated in water solution. And technically, in water, a proton is hydrated to produce the hydronium ion: \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O + proton \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_0 \\tag{10.1} \\end{equation}\\] So technically, donating a proton for an acid necessarily involves the molecule of water as in the equilibrium (10.2) \\[\\begin{equation} acid + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ + conjugate \\: base \\hspace{2.5cm} K_1 \\tag{10.2} \\end{equation}\\] One can dissociate, however this reaction in two elementary reactions as \\[\\begin{equation} acid \\rightleftharpoons proton + conjugate \\: base \\hspace{2.5cm} K_2 \\\\ H_2O + proton \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_0 \\tag{10.3} \\end{equation}\\] Because the activity of water is essentially constant in dilute aqueous solutions, the hydration of the proton can be ignored in defining acid-base equilibria (Stumm and Morgan 1996). The thermodynamic convention sets the standard free enery change ΔG° for reaction (10.1) equal to zero, of its rate constant K0=1. So from now on, the molecule of water is purposely omitted in acid-base reactions herein, and the hydrated proton is written as H+. In the equilibrium (10.4) below, the acid is represented as HA. It can donate a proton H+. The anion A- is referred to as the conjugate base. \\[\\begin{equation} HA \\rightleftharpoons A^- + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_A \\tag{10.4} \\end{equation}\\] Another example of an acid, is illustrated in equilibrium (10.5) where the acid is an anion (cation in the generic example below), and the conjugate base is an uncharged molecule. \\[\\begin{equation} HA^+ \\rightleftharpoons A + H^+ \\tag{10.5} \\end{equation}\\] Some molecules can be both an acid and a base: they are referred to as being amphoteric. Water is the most famous amphoteric molecule as it can donate a proton to yield a hydroxide OH-, or gain an electron to form the hydronium cation H3O+ as illustrated in equilibria (10.6) \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O \\rightleftharpoons OH^- + H^+ \\\\ H_2O + H^+ \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ \\tag{10.6} \\end{equation}\\] By convention, however, the acid conjugate is always placed on the left of the equilibria, and the conjugate base and the proton H+ are placed on the right side of the equilibrium. 10.2 Acid-base equilibrium parameters 10.2.1 KA Like for all chemical reactions, it is possible to write down the equilibrium constant as the product of the activities of the products divided by the product of the activities of the reactants as in equation (10.7): \\[\\begin{equation} K_A = \\frac{\\{A^-\\}\\{H^+\\}}{\\{HA\\}} \\tag{10.7} \\end{equation}\\] where the activity of HA is written as \\(\\{HA\\}\\). For natural waters, a very good approximation of an element chemical activities is its concentration and the expression of KA can be expressed as in equation (10.8): \\[\\begin{equation} K_A = \\frac{[A^-][H^+]}{[HA]} \\tag{10.8} \\end{equation}\\] where, e.g., the concentration of HA can be written as \\([HA]\\). 10.2.2 pKA When the concentration of both conjugate acids and bases are equal in a solution, the expression of KA in equation (10.8) is simplified into \\[\\begin{equation} K_A = [H^+] \\tag{10.9} \\end{equation}\\] Taking the negative of the common logarithm (base 10) on both side yields: \\[\\begin{equation} -log(K_A) = -log \\left([H^+]\\right) \\tag{10.10} \\end{equation}\\] The right side of equation (10.10) is the definition of the pH. By analogy, one can define a new term \\[\\begin{equation} pK_A = -log(K_A) \\tag{10.11} \\end{equation}\\] which corresponds to the pH value at which the concentrations of the conjugate acid and base are equal. 10.3 Self-ionization of water In all aqueous solutions, the following reaction (10.12), referred to as the autoprotolysis must be considered: \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons OH^- + H_3O^+ \\tag{10.12} \\end{equation}\\] Since in dilute solution the activity of water \\({ \\{H_2O \\} = 1}\\) the equilibrium constant for equilibrium (10.12), often referred to as the ‘ion product’ or ‘ionic product’ of water can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} K_w = \\{OH^-\\} \\{H_3O^+\\} \\equiv \\{OH^-\\} \\{H^+\\} \\tag{10.13} \\end{equation}\\] According to Stumm and Morgan (1996), at 25°C, Kw = 1.008 × 10-14 and the pH = 7.00 corresponds to the exact neutrality in pure water ([H+] = [OH-]) Technically, Kw changes with temperature, according to equation (10.14) (Harned and Owen 1958) \\[\\begin{equation} log K_w = \\frac{-4470.99}{T} + 6.0875 - 0.01706 T \\tag{10.14} \\end{equation}\\] With temperatures T expressed in °K. One can see in Figure 10.1 that the pH at exact neutrality varies with T°C reaching 7.37 at 5°C and decreasing down to about 6.84 at 35°C. So contrary to the common understanding that pH at neutrality is equal to 7, it actually changes with temperature, and not on an insignificant way. This is a reason why it is preferrable to calibrate pH probes using pH buffer solutions in the lab near 25°C. For all calculation purposes in this chapter, we will assume that the temperature is at 25°C, and we can therefore take that pH=7 at neutrality and that log Kw=-14. Figure 10.1: Kw and pH at exact neutrality as a function of T°C 10.4 Strong vs. weak acids The concept of ionization of water defines the limits within which water activity remains equal to one, while the hydroxyde OH- and hydronium H3O+ or simpler proton H+ coexist. At pH=0, all the ionization is in the form of H+, and conversely, at pH=14, all the autoprololysis of water yields only OH-. Beyond these limits, i.e., pH less than 0 and greater than 14, one cannot consider these dilute solutions in water anymore. So all acids for which the pKA (i.e., -log(KA)) is beyond the 0 to 14 values, are considered strong acids or strong bases. This means that in dilute solutions, the acid (or the base) can be considered entirely dissociated into its conjugate base (or acid). To better understand this, let us take nitric acid for which the pKA=-1.4. This means that there is as much HNO3 as there is NO3- at pH=-1.4. So for dilute solutions, we can consider that all HNO3 has been dissociated into NO3-, and that in fact there is no measurable HNO3 in solution. Conversely, all other acids for with the pKA is within 0 and 14 are considered weak acids, because depending on the pH, they can be either be in the HA or A- forms, if we take our generic equilibrium example (10.4). It turns out that many inorganic nutrients of interest and all organic acids are weak acids. This property makes them either undergo transformations depending on the controling pH, but also makes them play a very significant role in buffering the ambient pH. These weak acids are in large part responsible for the relative narrow range of pH in natural waters included in most cases between 4.5 and 8.5. 10.5 Mono- and polyprotic acids mole fractions The first equilibrium (10.4) illustrates the case of a monoprotic acid, i.e., that can donate only one proton. For our purposes, important monoprotic acids include \\(HSO_4^{2-}\\) and \\(NH_4^+\\). Among the inorganic nutrients important to environmental and ecological engineering, several are polyprotic acids, namely, phosphates, carbonates, and hydrogen sulfides. Polyprotic acids are acids that can donate more than one proton. Because they have the ability to donate or gain a proton, these polyprotic acids play a very special role in buffering the pH of streams, ground, lake, and sea waters, as well as that of soil pore water. The mono- and polyprotic acids mentioned above can take several forms, depending on the pH. Reversely, some of the biogeochemical processes at play, e.g., in streams or a wetland soil, will tend to add or remove some of the conjugate forms, possibly modifying the local pH over time. An important tool to understand the role played by environmentally important weak acids is to calculate the relative mole fraction of each of the conjugate forms as a function of pH. In the following, we will illustrate how to calculate the mole fraction for an example triprotic acid, as well as in the general case of an acid able to donate n protons; results of the general case will apply in particular to the monoprotic acids as well. 10.5.1 Triprotic acid example Let us take a generic triprotic acid able to donate up to three protons. Three equilibrium reactions coexist in solution, in addition to the autoprotolysis of water (10.15). Before we start the calculations of the mole fractions, let us establish some simple methodological rules that greatly help solve many of chemistry problems. Always: Write all the reaction equilibria at play and the corresponding equilibrium constants list all the ionic forms at play List all the non-ionic forms Establish the electroneutrality of the solution by balancing the positive and negative charges of the ions at play Establish the conservation of mass when possible Equilibria at play: \\[\\begin{equation} H_3A \\rightleftharpoons H_2A^- + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_1 = \\frac{[H_2A^-][H^+]}{[H_3A]}\\\\ H_2A^- \\rightleftharpoons HA^{2-} + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_2 = \\frac{[H_2A^-][H^+]}{[HA^{2-}]}\\\\ HA^{2-} \\rightleftharpoons A^{3-} + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_3 = \\frac{[HA^{2-}][H^+]}{[A^{3-}]}\\\\ H_2O \\rightleftharpoons OH^- + H^+ \\hspace{2.5cm} K_w = [H^+][OH^-] \\tag{10.15} \\end{equation}\\] List of the ionic forms: cations: \\(H^+\\) anions: \\(H_2A^-\\), \\(HA^{2-}\\), \\(A^{3-}\\), \\(OH^-\\) List of all other forms: \\(H_3A\\), \\(H_2O\\) Electroneutrality of the solution: \\([H^+] = [H_2A^-] + 2\\times[HA^{2-}] + 3\\times[A^{3-}] + [OH^-]\\) The factor 2 before \\(2\\times[HA^{2-}]\\) expresses the relative contribution of the concentration \\([HA^{2-}]\\) to the total negative charge. The same is true for \\(3\\times[A^{3-}]\\). Conservation of mass: The summation of all the conjugate forms is often referred to as ‘total concentration’ or \\(C_T\\) \\(C_T = [H_3A] + [H_2A^-] + [HA^{2-}] + [A^{3-}]\\) After establishing the constraint of the systems, it is possible to evaluate the relative abundance of each of the conjugate forms, i.e., the mole fraction or the ratio between concentration of each form and \\(C_T\\). To get there, let us first express each of the conjugate forms as a function of \\([H_3A]\\). Using the equations for the reaction constants, and combining the expressions of \\(K_1\\), \\(K_2\\), and \\(K_3\\) from (10.15), it is possible to obtain: \\[\\begin{equation} [H_2A^-] = [H_3A] \\frac{K_1}{[H^+]} \\\\ [HA^{2-}] = [H_3A] \\frac{K_1K_2}{[H^+]^2} \\\\ [A^{3-}] = [H_3A] \\frac{K_1K_2K_3}{[H^+]^3} \\\\ \\tag{10.16} \\end{equation}\\] Replacing the expressions of each conjugate forms in (10.16) above, the equation of the conservation of mass then becomes: \\[\\begin{equation} C_T = [H_3A] \\times \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_1}{[H^+]} + \\frac{K_1K_2}{[H^+]^2} + \\frac{K_1K_2K_3}{[H^+]^3}\\right) \\tag{10.17} \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} C_T = [H_3A] \\times \\left( \\frac{[H^+]^3 + K_1[H^+]^2 + K_1K_2[H^+] + K_1K_2K_3}{[H^+]^3}\\right) \\tag{10.18} \\end{equation}\\] The molar fraction \\(\\alpha_0\\) of the fully protonated acid can be expressed as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha_0 = \\frac{[H_3A]}{C_T} \\tag{10.19} \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha_0 = \\frac{[H^+]^3}{[H^+]^3 + K_1[H^+]^2 + K_1K_2[H^+] + K_1K_2K_3} \\tag{10.20} \\end{equation}\\] By analogy, and using the reaction constant equations, the other molar fractions can be expressed as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha_1 = \\frac{[H_2A^-]}{C_T} = \\frac{K_1[H^+]^2}{[H^+]^3 + K_1[H^+]^2 + K_1K_2[H^+] + K_1K_2K_3} \\tag{10.21} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha_2 = \\frac{[HA^{2-}]}{C_T} = \\frac{K_1K_2[H^+]}{[H^+]^3 + K_1[H^+]^2 + K_1K_2[H^+] + K_1K_2K_3} \\tag{10.22} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha_3 = \\frac{[A^{3-}]}{C_T} = \\frac{K_1K_2K_3}{[H^+]^3 + K_1[H^+]^2 + K_1K_2[H^+] + K_1K_2K_3} \\tag{10.23} \\end{equation}\\] Notice that for all mole fractions, the denominator does not change, only the numerator does. 10.5.2 Generalized polyprotic acid mole fractions The example above can be used to draw the general case of a polyprotic acid which can donate n protons (including for n = 1). Using the same methodology as before (Chameides and Perdue 1997): Equilibria at play: \\[\\begin{equation} H_nA \\rightleftharpoons H_{n-1}A^- + H^+ \\hspace{0.6cm} K_{a1} = \\frac{[H_{n-1}A^-][H^+]}{[H_nA]} \\hspace{0.6cm} [H_{n-1}A^-] = [H_nA] \\frac {K_{a1}}{[H^+]}\\\\ H_{n-1}A^- \\rightleftharpoons H_{n-2}A^{2-} + H^+ \\hspace{0.6cm} K_{a2} = \\frac{[H_{n-2}A^{2-}][H^+]}{[H_{n-1}A]} \\hspace{0.6cm} [H_{n-2}A^-] = [H_nA] \\frac {K_{a1}K_{a2}}{[H^+]^2}\\\\ \\\\ \\vdots \\hspace{6cm} \\vdots \\hspace{6cm} \\vdots\\\\ \\\\ HA^{(n-1)-} \\rightleftharpoons A^{n-} + H^+ \\hspace{0.6cm} K_{an} = \\frac{[A^{n-}][H^+]}{[HA^{(n-1)-}]} \\hspace{0.6cm} [A^{n-}] = [H_nA] \\frac {K_{a1}K_{a2} \\ldots K_{an}}{[H^+]^n}\\\\ \\tag{10.24} \\end{equation}\\] List of the ionic forms: cations: \\(H^+\\) anions: \\(H_{n-1}A^-\\), \\(H_{n-2}A^{2-}\\), … , \\(A^{n-}\\), \\(OH^-\\) List of all other forms: \\(H_nA\\), \\(H_2O\\) Electroneutrality of the solution: \\([H^+] = [H_{n-1}A^-] + 2\\times[H_{n-2}A^{2-}] \\space + \\space ... \\space + \\space n\\times[A^{n-}] + [OH^-]\\) Conservation of mass: The summation of all the conjugate forms is often referred to as ‘total concentration’ or \\(C_T\\) \\(C_T = [H_nA] + [H_{n-1}A^-] + ... + [A^{n-}]\\) The generalized equation for the mole fraction \\(i\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha_i = \\frac{[H_{n-i}A^{(n-i)-}]}{C_T} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\alpha_i = \\frac{K_{a1}K_{a2} \\ldots K_{ai}[H^+]^{n-i}}{[H^+]^n + K_{a1}[H^+]^{n-1} + K_1K_2[H^+]^{n-2} + \\dots + K_{a1}K_{a2}\\dots K_{an}} \\tag{10.25} \\end{equation}\\] 10.5.3 Graphical illustration of mole fractions of ecologically relevant weak acids Now that we have defined the expressions for the molar fraction of weak acids, it is time to apply the generalized equation (10.25) to ecologically relevant weak acids. Let us start with ammonium \\(NH_4^+\\) and its conjugate base \\(NH_3\\). At 25°C, the pKA is 9.28, or at pH = 9.28, \\([NH_4^+] = [NH_3]\\). At pH less than pKA, \\(NH_4^+\\) is the preponderant form, and at pH greater than pKA, \\(NH_3\\) becomes the preponderant form. One can see in Figure 10.2, that at pH less than 8, the molar fraction of ammonia is less than 5% of the total \\([NH_4^+] + [NH_3]\\) (sometimes referred to as Total Amoniacal Nitrogen, or TAN). For this reason, in most natural waters, \\([NH_4^+]\\) is by far the most preponderant form. Because in most natural waters, the concentrations of \\(NH_4^+\\) is relatively low (~&lt; 0.2 mg N/L), there is very little loss of ammonia through volatilization. However, in animal waste water such as hog lagoons as they exist in North Carolina, ammonia volatilization is important. The pH of these lagoons range from 6.5 to 8.5 for an average of 7.8 (Barker, Zublena, and Walls 1994), yielding 3% of the TAN as ammonia. However, the total TAN concentration can easily reach 1000 to 2000 mg N/L, resulting in \\([NH_3]\\) between 30 and 60 mg N/L. The potential for ammonia volatilization is thus very high and occurs despite low molar fractions. Figure 10.2: Molar fraction for ammonium and ammonia in dilute solutions at 25°C The phosphate anion (\\(PO_4^{3-}\\)) has three conjugate acids, and is the deprotonated form of the triprotic phosphoric acid. The pKA of the conjugate forms are at 25°C 2.12, 7.21, and 12.67. The preponderant forms present at pH between 4.5 and 8.5 are thus dihydrogen (\\(H_2PO_4^-\\)) and hydrogen (\\(HPO_4^{2-}\\)) phosphates (Figure 10.3). The byproduct of microbial respiration that finds its way into natural waters is thus rarely if ever \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) unlike presented in Chapter 7… The \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) form is still commonly used as a generic ‘phosphate’ molecule, regardless of pH considerations. Figure 10.3: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the triprotic phosphoric acid in dilute solutions at 25°C In most natural waters with pH between 4.5 and 8.5, sulfate is the preponderant form, and in the vast majority of cases, there is very little \\(HSO_4^-\\) (Figure 10.4). This figure also suggests that sulfuric acid (\\(H_2SO_4^{2-}\\)) does not exist in dilute waters in this form. Figure 10.4: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the hydrogen sulfate and sulfate in dilute solutions at 25°C Now, technically an important piece of information should have been added for the the ammonium/ammonia molar fraction graph. Because ammonia is a gas that can equilibrate with the atmosphere, and is therefore an open system, the graph illustrated in Figure 10.2 corresponds to the case of a ‘closed system’, and in particular a system not directly open to the atmosphere. In reality, because of the pH range in natural waters, and the fact that ammonium is by far the most preponderant form, even when open to the atmosphere, the ammonium/ammonia equilibrium behaves very much like a closed system, in the case of low total ammoniacal concentrations. Now, for dihydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide/carbonic acid, the volatile forms are present in very significant amounts for pH of natural waters. Because the molar fraction equation (10.25) only applies in closed systems, one might suggest that natural systems are in fact open systems, such that equation (10.25) just should not be used. True for open waters. However, there are lots of other ‘captive’ waters such as groundwater or sediment porewater, that are not directly open to the atmosphere and for which it is possible to use the molar fraction equation (10.25). The pKa of the dihydrogen sulfide/hydrogen sulfide is 7.02 at 25°C, and there is still about 10% of \\(H_2S\\) at pH=8 (Figure 10.5). The sulfide ion \\(S^{2-}\\), for most natural waters is not present and for the normal range of pH of natural waters, the two significant forms are \\(H_2S\\) and \\(HS^-\\). There are consequences on bubble formation or gas ebullition in aquatic sediments as we shall see herein. Figure 10.5: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the hydrogen sulfide in dilute solutions at 25°C Similarly to the hydrogen sulfide polyprotic acid, carbon dioxide in water can become hydrated and (theoretically) become the diprotic carbonic acid, which can donate up to two electrons. For the normal range of pH of natural waters, the two significant forms are \\(H_2CO_3^o\\) and \\(HCO_3^-\\). \\(H_2CO_3^o\\) represents the combined \\(CO_{2(aq)}\\) and the true carbonic acid \\(H_2CO_3\\) (further details in the phase transition part below). Figure 10.6: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, and carbonate in dilute solutions at 25°C At least two byproducts of respiratory processes are gasesOne of the consequences on wetland sediment porewater chemistry, is that the pH being relatively acidic, most of the inorganic sulfur byproduct of sulfur respiration are in the \\(H_2S\\) form. \\(H_2S\\) stays in the dissolved form until the summation of the partial pressure of all the dissolved gases becomes greater than one atmosphere plus the height of the water column above. Another intersting example of a triprotic acid is citric acid, the molecule at the center of the citric acid cycle. Figure 10.7: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the triprotic citric acid in dilute solutions at 25°C Another intersting example of a diprotic acid is malonic acid. Figure 10.8: Molar fraction for the conjugate acid forms of the triprotic citric acid in dilute solutions at 25°C Another interesting example of a diprotic acid is oxalic acid.

The beginning of this paragraph mentions time series. Indeed, in hydrology we no longer measure flow on a continuous basis, but rather at a given frequency. From the late 1880s to the early 1980s though, hydrographs were, always at the beginning and, in many cases later on, automatically drawn on paper by a scribing pen on a roll of paper. These would move relative to the other as a function of the variable stage of the nearby stream or river, thereby creating a true continuous record of stage variations or a continuous hydrograph. Nowadays, however, the vast majority not to say all of the hydrological data are collected by electronic equipment at a given time interval and logged on memory chips at a given logging interval. Thanks to hydrological instruments, we have been able to make measurements of river stages continuously or at a near continuous pace, i.e., at a high frequency (hourly or smaller), for nearly 150 years. From this high frequency data, it has been possible to calculate flow rates and obtain a visual representation of typical variations of flow following a rainfall event. The first example below is an example of what we refer to as a simple hydrograph, which follows a rainfall event, with an initial baseflow, a rapidly rising limb, a flow peak, and a more slowly falling limb. hydgph&lt;-read.csv(file = &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francoisbirgand/discharge_and_flux_calculations/master/hydgph.csv&quot;, header = TRUE) names(hydgph)=c(&quot;date&quot;,&quot;Q&quot;,&quot;NO3&quot;) date=as.POSIXct(hydgph$date, format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;) # transforms the first column of the file, which are characters into dates that R understands Q=hydgph$Q*1000 # Puts in the variable Q the flow rates, which are orginally in m³/s to L/s for better visualization par(mar=c(4.5,4.5,0.5,0.5)) xlimHG=as.POSIXct(c(&quot;1999-01-03 00:00:00&quot;,&quot;1999-01-08 00:00:00&quot;));ylimHG=c(50,350) # this defines the plotting ranges for the x and y axes plot(date,Q,xlab = &quot;date&quot;,ylab = &quot;Flow rate (L/s)&quot;,type = &quot;p&quot;,col=&quot;blue&quot;,xlim=xlimHG,ylim=ylimHG) # this plots the hydrograph Although the points are disjointed, it is very tempting to add a line between them, as our observations and intuitions tell us that there is a pattern of flow up or down, and in this example, the time interval between consecutive values is 600 seconds or 10 min. And indeed, this is exactly what hydrologists do, we add lines between points as an approximation of what flow must have looked like during the measurement intervals. The same data plotted without the measurement points looks like the figure below, appears continuous, although it is not! 11.1.1 Characteristics of a hydrograph A hydrograph is characterized by a fast rising limb, and a slower falling limb. This is the typical response of flow following a rainfall event. The time it takes to go from the beginning of what we refer to as an event to the peak is called time of rise. The maximum of the flow rate is referred to as peakflow. 11.1.2 Actual hydrograph over an entire year The goal of the first part above was to realize that there is no such thing as continuous data, but that really all data around the world is an assemblage of discontinuous data points. In the case of hydrological data, all points are auto-correlated, and provided that flow be measured frequently enough, then a linear interpolation between consecutive points is just fine. Now, let us explore what a typical yearly hydrograph of a watershed in a temperate climate where snow does not play a significant role. The conventional acronym for flow rates is the letter Q. data&lt;-read.csv(file=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francoisbirgand/francoisbirgand.github.io/master/data/sample_1hr_QC_data.csv&quot;,header = TRUE) #Reads file into table format WSarea&lt;-24.2 #Area of watershed in km2 WS&lt;-&quot;Maudouve at Saint-Donan, France&quot; names(data)=c(&quot;datetime&quot;,&quot;Q&quot;,&quot;C&quot;) # renames the columns in simpler names data&lt;-as.data.frame(data) data$datetime&lt;-as.POSIXct(strptime(data$datetime, &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;)) # transforms characters into date values understood by R D&lt;-data$datetime Q&lt;-data$Q #Defines Q as the flow value (m3/s) N=nrow(data) #Sets N to the value equal to the number of total rows in the table # definition of the x and y axes limits startdate&lt;-D[1] enddate&lt;-D[N] xlim = as.POSIXct(c(startdate,enddate)) # this renders the first and last date understandable for plotting purposes ylimQ = c(0,max(Q)) # ylim for flow ScaleF = 1.2 # scaling factor for size of fonts and other things y1lab&lt;-expression(&quot;Flow rate (&quot; * m^3 * &quot;/s)&quot;) # defines the label for flow par(mar=c(4.5,4.5,4,4.5)) # defines the sizes, in number of lines, for the margins (bottom, left, top, right) ltyp=c(1,2) plot(D,Q,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylimQ) # we are taking all the default addition of axis tick marks and numbers out by using xaxt and yaxt = &quot;n&quot; # and setting the axis labels at nothing using xlab = &quot;&quot; and ylab = &quot;&quot; abline(h=0) abline(v=seq(startdate, enddate, by=&quot;week&quot;),col=(&quot;grey&quot;)) axis.POSIXct(1, at=seq(startdate, enddate, by=&quot;month&quot;), format=&quot;%m/%d&quot;,cex.axis=ScaleF) # this tells R that we want the X axis ticks and values to be displayed as dates, be added on a monthly basis, # using the month/day format axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) # this tells R that the first Y axis ticks can be displayed (that function was repressed earlier by &#39;yaxt=&quot;n&quot; &#39;) par(new=TRUE) # this tells R that a new plot has already been opened, in other words you are telling R to keep adding things # on the existing plot mtext(&quot;Dates in 1997-1998&quot;,side=1,line=3,cex=ScaleF) # add in the margin the defined labels and title mtext(y1lab,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) mtext(WS,side=3,line=1.5,cex=ScaleF) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;,c(&quot;Flow&quot;),lty = c(1), col = c(&quot;blue&quot;)) Notice that one can see individual hydrographs characterized for the rapid rise of flow rates, followed by a rapid fall. But they seem to occur on top of a transient minimum flow rate. The latter is called baseflow. It corresponds to the stream water exclusively fed by groundwater. You can see in this example that there is very low baseflow from September 1st to the 3rd week of October. A large event around that time raises the baseflow to about 250 L/s and this stays almost stable until the end of the third week of December. This is the time when most of the rainfall starts in this part of the world and heavy rainfall last until the middle of January. The baseflow during these 1.5 months rose above 600 L/s. It took about an entire month with nearly no rainfall from the last week of January to the last week of Febraury for baseflow to go down to the pre-December values. Baseflow stays at that general level between the last week of February to the first week of April. Then a series of large rainfall events raise the baseflow back to high levels throughout the month of April. Again, it takes again about one month for baseflow to decrease and then stay stable throughout the month of June. In July and August, even a relative large event at the end of the first week of July does not raise the baseflow level, which steadily disminishes until the beginning of September. 11.1.3 Calculating water fluxes or cumulative flow volumes Flow peaks matter very much for flooding issues and an entire domain of hydrology and statistical hydrology is devoted to calculating and predicting flow peaks generating floods. For water quality purposes, flow volumes matter just as much as flow peaks do. Indeed, the amount or load of pollutants leaving a field or a watershed, or delivered in a receiving water body, depends on the total volume of water, and, on the concentrations. Flow volumes or cumulative flows, correspond to the cumulative volume of water that has passed at a particular point over a given period. Mathematically, this means that flow volumes correspond to the integral over time of the instantaneous flow rates. or \\[ CumulQ = \\int_{}^{period}{Q(t).dt} \\] In practice, because the instantaneous flow rates are discrete in time, \\[ CumulQ = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}{\\frac{(Q_i + Q_{i+1})}{2}}.time \\space interval \\] If we zoom on a hypothetical hydrograph named TS (time series), this corresponds to cumulating the area under each trapeze represented below. par(mar=c(4.5,4.5,0.5,0.5)) x&lt;-1:10 TS&lt;-25-(x-5)^2+2;xlim=c(0,11);ylim=c(0,30) plot(x,TS,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim) date&lt;-as.character(date) # need to transfer dates back into character to make some operations polygx&lt;-cbind(head(x,-1),head(x,-1),x[-1],x[-1],head(x,-1)) # x values of the polygons polygy&lt;-cbind(rep(0,length(TS)-1),head(TS,-1),TS[-1],rep(0,length(TS)-1),rep(0,length(TS)-1)) # y values of the polygons for (j in 1:(length(TS)-1)){polygon((as.vector(polygx[j,])),as.vector(polygy[j,]),col=&quot;lightblue&quot;)} date&lt;-as.POSIXct(date) par(new=TRUE) plot(x,TS,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim) One could calculate the cumulative flow by adding over time the area under each trapeze at in the example below. The result of this mock unitless ‘hydrograph’ are displayed underneath. cumTS_inst=matrix(0,10,1) # 10 values, the first one being 0 to associate to initial time for (i in 1:9){QQ=(TS[i]+TS[i+1])/2;cumTS_inst[i+1]=cumTS_inst[i]+QQ} as.vector(cumTS_inst) ## [1] 0.0 14.5 35.0 59.5 86.0 112.5 137.0 157.5 172.0 178.5 It turns out that in R, there is a very smart and simple way to calculate cumulative flow, loads, etc. of a time series (TS here) using the code below: time_interval=1 c(0,(cumsum(TS[-1])+cumsum(head(TS,-1)))/2)*time_interval ## [1] 0.0 14.5 35.0 59.5 86.0 112.5 137.0 157.5 172.0 178.5 The magic comes the function cumsum() which calculates the cumulative sum of a vector and generates a vector of the same length of the original one: cumsum(c(1,2,1,2,1,2)) ## [1] 1 3 4 6 7 9 and the fact that each trapeze is the average of two rectangles represented below: par(mar=c(4.5,4.5,0.5,0.5)) plot(x,TS,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim) suprectxy=cbind(1:9,rep(0,9),2:10,TS[2:10]) infrectxy=cbind(1:9,rep(0,9),2:10,TS[1:9]) for (i in 1:9){rect(infrectxy[i,1],infrectxy[i,2],infrectxy[i,3],infrectxy[i,4],col = transpblue)} for (i in 1:9){rect(suprectxy[i,1],suprectxy[i,2],suprectxy[i,3],suprectxy[i,4],col = transpred)} Let us apply this method to the Maudouve hydrograph plotted earlier. Calculating the cumulative flow corresponds to integrating under the hydrograph curve, as represented by the grey area on the left panel. The corresponding cumulative flow, expressed in mm is plotted on the right side of the plots. par(mfrow = c(3,2));par(mar=c(4.5,5,0.5,0.5)) xlim = as.POSIXct(c(startdate,enddate)) n=c(2500,4500,N) for (i in 1:3){ plot(0,0,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylimQ) abline(h=0) axis.POSIXct(1, at=seq(startdate, enddate, by=&quot;month&quot;), format=&quot;%m/%d&quot;,cex.axis=ScaleF) axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) polygon(c(D[1:n[i]],D[n[i]:1]),c(Q[1:n[i]],rep(0,n[i])),col=&quot;grey&quot;) par(new=TRUE) plot(D,Q,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylimQ) mtext(&quot;Dates in 1997-1998&quot;,side=1,line=3,cex=ScaleF) # add in the margin the defined labels and title mtext(y1lab,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) cumQ=c(0,(cumsum(Q[-1])+cumsum(head(Q,-1)))/2)*3600/WSarea/1000 # calculates in mm the cumulative flow for each time stamp plot(D[1:n[i]],cumQ[1:n[i]],col=&quot;red&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=c(0,cumQ[N])) abline(h=0) abline(h=seq(0,1000,by=50),lty=2,col=&quot;lightgrey&quot;) axis.POSIXct(1, at=seq(startdate, enddate, by=&quot;month&quot;), format=&quot;%m/%d&quot;,cex.axis=ScaleF) axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) par(new=TRUE) mtext(&quot;Dates in 1997-1998&quot;,side=1,line=3,cex=ScaleF) # add in the margin the defined labels and title mtext(&quot;Cumulative Flow volume (mm)&quot;,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) } print(signif(max(cumQ),digits = 3)) # displays the final cumulative flow value in m3 ## [1] 378 Figure 11.1: Video illustrating the calculation of cumulative volume by integrating under a hydrograph. Notice that the two high flow periods in January and April participate in a large proportion of the total cumulative volume Notice that most of the increase of the cumulative flow occurs during the January and April periods described above. 11.1.4 Evaluating the importance of rare high flow events: flow duration curves 11.1.4.1 Sorting flow and load values Flow occurs permanent streams throughout the year, but with bursts following rainfall events, which are, in most places on earth relatively rare. For example, in North Carolina, it rains about 7% of the time. Most of the flow occurs after these rare occurrences. The idea behind the duration curve concept is to characterize the importance of high flow events in the overall volume of water generated. Flow duration curves represent the percentage of the total flow that occurred in x% of the time corresponding to the highest flows. The same applies for loads. This might sound a bit murky, but hopefully it will not with the further explanations below. To get there, one first needs to order flow and loads in descending order. QSort=sort(Q,decreasing = TRUE) #Sorts instantaneous flow rates in descending order One can also calculate the cumulative flow associated with the sorted instantaneous flow rates as follows: cumQSort&lt;-c(0,(cumsum(QSort[-1])+cumsum(head(QSort,-1)))/2)*3600/WSarea/1000 cumQSortPerc&lt;-cumQSort/tail(cumQSort,1)*100 The blue hydrograph from above now becomes: par(mar=c(4.5,4.5,1,1)) plot(1:length(QSort),QSort,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,ylim=ylimQ) abline(h=0) axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) mtext(y1lab,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) mtext(&quot;Cumulative number of flow values&quot;,side=1,line=3,cex=ScaleF) legend(&quot;topright&quot;,c(&quot;Sorted Flow&quot;),lty = c(1), col = c(&quot;blue&quot;)) So now the cumulative flow volume curve corresponding to the highest flow rates as a function, not of time anymore but of the cumulative number of flow values looks like this: par(mar=c(4.5,5.5,1,1)) plot(cumQSortPerc,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;, ylim=c(0,100)) abline(h=0) axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) mtext(&quot;Cumulative number of flow values&quot;,side=1,line=1,cex=ScaleF) mtext(&quot;%age of cumulative flow corresponding to\\n the highest sorted flow rates &quot;,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) # the \\n in the text allows for line break in the title This corresponds to the integration under the curve of the sorted hydrograph as in: par(mfrow = c(3,2));par(mar=c(4.5,5,0.5,0.5)) xlim = as.POSIXct(c(startdate,enddate)) n=c(2500,4500,N) for (i in 1:3){ plot(0,0,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=c(1,length(Q)),ylim=ylimQ) abline(h=0) axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) polygon(c(1:n[i],n[i]:1),c(QSort[1:n[i]],rep(0,n[i])),col=&quot;grey&quot;) par(new=TRUE) plot(1:length(QSort),QSort,col=&quot;blue&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=c(1,length(Q)),ylim=ylimQ) mtext(y1lab,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) plot(1:n[i],cumQSort[1:n[i]],col=&quot;red&quot;,type=&quot;l&quot;,cex=0.1,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, lty=ltyp[1],xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlab=&quot;&quot;,ylab=&quot;&quot;,xlim=c(1,length(Q)),ylim=c(0,cumQ[N])) abline(h=0) abline(h=seq(0,1000,by=50),lty=2,col=&quot;lightgrey&quot;) axis(2,cex.axis=ScaleF) par(new=TRUE) mtext(&quot;Cumulative Flow volume (mm)&quot;,side=2,line=3,cex=ScaleF) } Notice that the cumulative sorted flow curve does not have the two large increases observed for the months of January and April anymore because all flows are sorted in decreasing order, regardless of when they occurred. Notice that there is still no unit added for the x axis because I decided that the cumulative number of flow value does not really add a lot to the analysis. However, it becomes very interesting to transform these values in probability of occurrence. Each value has 1/N the probability to occur. We can also calculate the cumulative probability of occurrence of flow values. Flow and load duration curves are thus derived this way. 11.1.5 Flow duration curves as flow exceedance curves The previous curves give the semi-continuous duration curves. In practice, we like to use discrete values or percentages to express ourselves. In other words, to characterize the importance of high flow in the generation of flow volume in a watershed, we like to say something like “50% of the flow in that watershed occurred in 10% of the time, corresponding to the highest flow”. This provides a way of demonstrating of how relatively flashy the watershed may be, either relatively to other watersheds or to previous years. The flashiness of a watershed refers to how rapidly flow is altered as a result of storm events/varying conditions. More frequent spikes in flow in response to precipitation events, in which flow increases and decreases more greatly and rapidly, are typically indicative of watersheds with predominant portions of streamflow being influenced by surface runoff, a quicker responding contributor of water to streamflow. Practically, one can associate to each cumulative sorted discharge value a percentage of the total discharge yielding Wk% values (W for Water volume) corresponding to the kth cumulative probability of the time elapsed, with k being an integer. This corresponds to discretize the continuous curves above to 100 points. Practically this can be calculated like this: Wk=quantile(cumQSort,probs=seq(0.01,1,0.01))/tail(cumQSort,1) #Calculates and assigns Wk% values to a probability occurring in 1-100% of the total time and the discretized flow duration curve is illustrated below: xlim=c(0,100);ylim=c(0,100); plot(1:100,Wk*100,xlab=&quot;Prob of Occurrence %&quot;,ylab=&quot;Mk% &amp; Wk%&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim,pch=21,col=&quot;black&quot;,bg=&quot;blue&quot;) par(new=TRUE) # plot(1:100,Mk*100,xlab=&quot;Prob of Occurrence %&quot;,ylab=&quot;Mk% &amp; Wk%&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim,pch=22,col=&quot;black&quot;,bg=ColElmt) # par(new=TRUE) abline(1,1,col=&quot;black&quot;,lty=&quot;dashed&quot;,xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim) par(new=TRUE) legend(&quot;bottomright&quot;,c(&quot;Cumul Q&quot;,&quot;Cumul NO3 load&quot;), pch=c(19), col=c(&quot;blue&quot;), bg=&quot;white&quot;) title(main=&quot;Nitrate Load and flow duration curves&quot;) # the \\n in the text allows for line break in the title One can then easily report that, for example, in 10% of the time corresponding to the highest flows, 41% of the flow occurred using this signif(Wk[10]*100,digits = 2)% code. This watershed is thus relatively flashy as about 41% of its total flow volume occurs in 10% of the time. Now, the interesting part of the curve is what happens for the low probability of occurrence because in this analysis, it corresponds to the highest flow. When one adds several curves on the same graph, it become difficult to distinguish the curves together. One way around that is to use log scale of the same graph using the code below. #Code for plotting the double cumulative plot using the normal distribution probabilities to zoom in on the lower tails v&lt;-c(1,2,3,5,10,25,50,75,90,95,97,98,99,100) #v is a set of user defined values of percentages of the total time to be used for calculating and plotting specific corresponding Wk% and Mk% values x&lt;-v/100 #Sets x as values of v in percentages # y&lt;-Mk[v] #Sets y as the set of Mk% values corresponding with percentages of the total time defined by values in x xx&lt;-qnorm(x) #qnorm takes a given probability (x values in this case) and returns the corresponding cumulative distribution value (Z-score) based on a normal distribution curve # yy&lt;-qnorm(y) #Here, qnorm is taking the percentages of the load that occur associated with percentages of the total time defined by values in x and calculating associated Z-scores according to a normal distribution curve yV&lt;-Wk[v] #Sets yV as the set of Wk% values corresponding with percentages of the total time defined by values in x yyV&lt;-qnorm(yV) #qnorm takes percentages of the flow occurring associated with percentages of the total time defined by x values and assigns Z-score values to each probability based on the normal distribution curve # yy&lt;-cbind(yy,yyV) #Binds both sets of Z-score values corresponding with Mk% (yy) and Wk% (yV) xx&lt;-cbind(xx,xx) #Binds both sets of Z-scores correspdonding with defined percentages of the total time (They are the same, this is for plotting purposes) # color&lt;-c(ColElmt,&quot;blue&quot;) #Defines the plot colors for yy and yV color&lt;-c(&quot;blue&quot;) #Defines the plot colors for yy and yV plot(xx[,1],yyV,xlab=&quot;Probability of Occurrence (%)&quot;,ylab=&quot;Wk%&quot;, type=&quot;o&quot;,xaxt=&quot;n&quot;,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;,xlim=c(-2.5,2.5),ylim=c(-2.5,2.5),pch=19,col=color) #Plots yy and yV values as a function of xx values par(new=TRUE) axis(1,at=xx[,1],labels=x*100) axis(2,at=xx[,1],labels=x*100) title(main=&quot;Double cumulative probability plot for flow volume&quot;) # the \\n in the text allows for line break in the title abline(h=xx,lty=3,col=&quot;grey&quot;) #Plots gridlines abline(v=xx,lty=3,col=&quot;grey&quot;) legend(&quot;bottomright&quot;,c(&quot;Cumul Q&quot;), pch=1, col=color, bg=&quot;white&quot;) 11.2 Chemographs and concentration levels With rapid changes in flow during events, concentrations vary just as well. This has remained pretty much hidden to most people until the 1980s because there was no easy way to measure water quality at the pace at which flow rates were measured. Since then instruments have been able to capture concentrations at a pace equal or close to that of flow monitoring. The curve that plots the variations of concentrations with flow is referred to as a chemograph. The nitrate annual chemograph for the Maudouve watershed presented above is illustrated below. data&lt;-read.csv(file=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francoisbirgand/francoisbirgand.github.io/master/data/sample_1hr_QC_data.csv&quot;,header = TRUE) #Reads file into table format WSarea&lt;-24.2 #Area of watershed in km2 WS&lt;-&quot;Maudouve at Saint-Donan, France&quot;

It varies opposite to flow variations, with the concentrations appearing relatively all the more diluted that flow is high. This is referred to as a dilution effect. Let us pause for a second and find other indicators of concentration over that the hydrograph period. It is easy to calculate the average or the median concentration over the four days selected here. The arithmetic average concentration can be calculated in the text using signif(mean(C),3), which yields 14.4 mg N/L. Similarly the median concentration is 14.8 mg N/L. These values are about three times the nitrate concentration values that I ask you to remember for most agricultural water: 5 mg N/L. This is because Brittany in France is a very intensive agricultural area where the denitrification capacities in watersheds are not quite as high as those observed in North Carolina for example. The level of concentration does give the general pollution level. But more interestingly, it allows to calculate pollutant loads, or the mass of pollutants that flows by a particular station. Instantaneous loads correspond to the mass of pollutant flowing per unit time at a station and its dimensions are [M.T-1]. Instantaneous loads for pollutants are the equivalent of flow rates for water. They are calculated as the product of flow by concentrations \\[ L(t) = Q(t).C(t) \\] Cumulative loads correspond to the cumulative mass of pollutants that has flowed by a station over a given period of time, and are the equivalent of cumulative flow volume for water. \\[ CumulLoad = \\int_{}^{period}{L(t).dt} = \\int_{}^{period}{Q(t).C(t).dt} \\] One can calculate the cumulative load of nitrate over the three days of record above using the following code: cumulLoad&lt;-c(0,(cumsum(L[-1])+cumsum(head(L,-1)))/2)*3600/1000 tail(cumulLoad,1) ## [1] 839.0834 So this means that over these 4 days, 839 kg N were discharged at that particular station. That is quite a bit!! In most stations around the world, however, to this day, researchers and water agencies do not have access to the continuous chemograph, but they are still trying to calculate loads. Because most stations do have continuous water flow measurements, one can use this information to calculate loads. Technically, the load calculated above for these 4 days can be calculated by multiplying the flow volume over these four days by the flow-weighted concentration (FWC) value. FWC in our example can be calculated as: \\[ FWC = \\frac{CumulLoad}{CumulQ} \\] cumulQ&lt;-c(0,(cumsum(Q[-1])+cumsum(head(Q,-1)))/2)*3600/1000 FWC&lt;-tail(cumulLoad,1)/tail(cumulQ,1) FWC ## [1] 12.91443 The FWC in our case here is 12.9 mg N/L, which quite a bit lower than the arithmetic average. This is expected as during the highest flows, the concentrations tend to be diluted. But in reality, people do not have access to the FWC, so one has to best estimate concentration. There are many different ways, all of which wrong, to estimate these FWC. One is to use the arithmetic average concentration as an estimate. By doing so, one obtains for an estimate of the load over this period using signif(mean(C)*tail(cumulQ,1),3), i.e., 937 kg, that is 12% more than the actual one. Let us now look at other datasets, that is data from the Cuyahoga River at Independence in Ohio. We are observing the same dilution effect pattern with nitrate for the Cuyahoga river. If we look at the TP concentrations, the concentrations increase with flow rates. This is referred to as a concentration effect. In fact the TP concentration peak is a little ahead of the flow peak in this particular case. ## [1] 30327.93 ## [1] 0.374828 The arithmetic average concentration for TP on these 8 days are 0.335 mg P/L. The FWC for TP for these 8 days is 0.374828 mg P/L, that is 11% more than the arithmetic average ones. This means that using the arithmetic average concentration to calculate loads will, for nutrients that have a concentration effect, underestimate loads. This chapter is still under construction "],

As a result, it tends to trace quantities in nature When dissolved in water, and depending on the pH of the solution, ammonia converts to ammonium following the reaction: \\[ H_2O + NH_3 \\rightleftharpoons OH^{-} + NH_4^{+} \\] Production: Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals. Dozens of chemical plants worldwide produce ammonia. Consuming more than 1% of all man-made power, ammonia production is a significant component of the world energy budget. In 2014, about 88% of the ammonia produced was used for fertilizing agricultural crops Modern ammonia-producing plants generally depend on the Haber-Bosch process which consists into reducing dinitrogen into ammonia \\[ 3\\,H_2 + N_2 \\to 2\\,NH_3 \\] Consumption: Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen-containing compounds. Virtually all synthetic nitrogen compounds are derived from ammonia. back to top 12.1.4 Ammonium Ammonium is the most reduced inorganic nitrogenous cation (positively charged). Ammonium 3D shape: Lewis dot structure: Number of electron N has for itself following electronegativity rule: eight It is formed by the protonation of ammonia following the reaction: \\[\\begin{equation} H_2O + NH_3 \\rightleftharpoons OH^{-} + NH_4^{+} \\tag{12.1} \\end{equation}\\] The relative abundance of ammonium vs ammonia depends on the pH of the solution. See figure below Because in most natural aqueous environments, pH is below 8, ammonium tends to be the preponderant form. Production: In nature, ammonium is a waste product of the mineralization of organic molecules It is added as fertilizer on soils as ammonium nitrate Health hazard: Ammonia vapor has a sharp, irritating, pungent odor that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death Drinking water standard: back to top 12.1.5 Ammonium nitrate Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound, the nitrate salt of the ammonium cation It is a white crystal solid and is highly soluble in water. Formula: \\(NH_4NO_3\\) 3D shape: It is predominantly used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer Its other major use is as a component of explosive mixtures used in mining, quarrying, and civil construction Production: Ammonium nitrate does exist naturally in mines of the Atacama desert in Chile but globally nearly all ammonium nitrate is now produced synthetically Byproduct of all respiration processes. Ammonium ions are a waste product of the metabolism of animals. In fish and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the urea cycle to urea, because urea is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into uric acid, which is solid and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss. Consumption/utilization: It is used as a fertilizer, because it tends to release inorganic nitrogen slowly in soil. Applied as a surface fertilizer, it penetrates the soil with rainfall infiltration. Highly soluble, the nitrate anion becomes readily available to plant roots, although it is susceptible to leaching below the root system into the shallow and deep groundwater. The ammonium cation tends to adsorb to soil particles and is thus not as susceptible to leaching. Ammonium can be directly uptaken by plant roots, which thermodynamically makes sense, although because in most soils aerobic conditions are preponderant, nitrate tends to be the ion uptaken most often. Soil bacteria in the aerobic zone of the soil will oxidize adsorbed ammonium into nitrate, which then becomes available for plant roots. The whole chain of events slows the release of inorganic nitrogen to crops and thus makes for more effective fertilizers.

Formula: CO2 Carbon dioxide 3D shape: Lewis dot structure: Number of electron C has for itself following electronegativity rule: zero CO2 can only be an electron acceptor Production: oxidation of C in all organic molecules Almost all respiratory processes on earth (some respiration does not involve oxidation of C) Combustion of all Carbon-based fuel Consumption: Photosynthesis Atmospheric carbon dioxide is the primary carbon source for life on Earth Calcite precipitation in the oceans Ecological Significance: Greenhouse Gas, which serves as reference for all other GHG Concentration in the atmosphere ~380 ppm on the rise, or 0.38%, or a partial pressure of 0.38 atm Carbon Dioxide variations through ancient and modern times concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from hundreds of thousands of years ago through 2015, measured in parts per million (ppm). The data come from a variety of historical ice core studies and recent air monitoring sites around the world. Each line represents a different data source (EPA 2016) Zooming in even more over the last few years and predictions, the Met Office in London predicted in early 2020 the continuous rise of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Carbon Dioxide variations from 2015 to 2021 In reality, concentrations are not stable, and vary widely in time and in space at the next two videos nicely show.

Carbonate serves as the carbon source for aquatic vegetation Carbonic acid can then dissociate into bicarbonate (\\(HCO_3^-\\)) and carbonate (\\(CO_3^{2-}\\)) The term “bicarbonate” was coined in 1814 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston. The prefix “bi” in “bicarbonate” comes from an outdated naming system and is based on the observation that there is twice as much carbonate (CO32−) per sodium ion in sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and other bicarbonates than in sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and other carbonates. The name lives on as a trivial name. (Wikipedia contributors 2018a). \\[\\begin{align} H_2CO_3 &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; HCO_3^- + H^+ \\tag{12.2} \\\\ HCO_3^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; CO_3^{2-} + H^+ \\tag{12.3} \\end{align}\\] In an environment not open to the atmosphere (or where direct exchange with the atmosphere is very limited like in stream or wetland sediment), the preponderant form depends on the pH and can be calculated as illustrated on the graph below. Carbon dioxide and carbonates are fully oxidized forms of inorganic molecules with just one atom of C: the carbon atom has zero electrons for itself as shown in Figure 12.1 Figure 12.1: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of C, including from left to right CO2, carbonic acid, hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate), and carbonate, showing that the C atoms have no electrons for themselves In sea water, Carbonate can combine with Ca2+ to form Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3), which precipitates out of solution. In other words, calcium carbonate formation is a sink for carbonate, and ultimately from CO2 addition from the atmosphere to to increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Carbonates are thus a great pH buffer in aquatic environments 12.3.3 Catabolism Reactions involving the breaking down of organic substrates, typically by oxidative breakdown, to provide chemically available energy (e.g. A TP) and/or to generate metabolic intermediates used in subsequent anabolic reactions (De Bolster 1997). Synonyms: Aerobic and anaerobic respirations which use organic molecules as electron donors, are synonyms of catabolism. In soil science another synonym of catabolism is mineralization, which refers to the decomposition or oxidation of the chemical compounds in organic matter releasing the nutrients contained in those compounds into soluble inorganic forms that may be plant-accessible (Wikipedia contributors 2018d). 12.4 D 12.4.1 Denitrification The microbially mediated dissimilatory reduction of nitrate into dinitrogen see denitrification in chapters for more details 12.4.2 Dihydrogen sulfide see hydrogen sulfide back to top 12.5 E 12.5.1 Eutrophication Definitions: ‘an increase in the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem’ (Nixon 1995) ‘is the enrichment of a water body with nutrients, usually with an excess amount of nutrients’ (Wikipedia) ‘the enrichment of water by nutrients, especially nitrogen and/or phosphorus, causing an accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms present in the water and to the quality of water concerned’ (Anonymous 1991b) ‘the enrichment of water by nitrogen compounds causing an accelerated growth of algae and higher forms of plant life to produce an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms present in the water and to the quality of water concerned’ (Anonymous 1991a) back to top 12.6 F 12.6.1 Fischer projection see Structural formula back to top 12.7 G 12.7.1 Greenhouse gases (GHG) A greenhouse gas is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the thermal infrared range.

Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth’s surface would be about −18 °C (0 °F), rather than the present average of 15 °C (59 °F). In the Solar System, the atmospheres of Venus, Mars and Titan also contain gases that cause a greenhouse effect.

In other words, for the pH of most natural waters (4.5 &lt; pH &lt; 8), \\(HNO_3\\) is totally insignificant. Production: from the complete oxidation of inorganic nitrogenous molecules which include ammonia, ammonium, nitrite from the mineralization and complete oxidation of amine radicals in organic molecules Consumption: Uptake from microbes, plants, and algae for their anabolism, which consists in building complex organic molecules from inorganic ones. Uptake, assimilation, anabolism, immobilization are all synonymous terms to express the fact that the N atom is immobilized, at least temporarily in organic molecules. Because N is assimilated in organic molecules during uptake/anabolism, and because N gains electrons in the process (it is thus reduced), we refer to nitrate uptake as assimilatory nitrate reduction. Denitrification: under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is used by facultative anaerobes as electron acceptor to generate ATP in their respiration chain. The two major end products of denitrification are gases, namely dinitrogen (\\(N_2\\)) and nitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\)), which leave the aqueous environment. As such, nitrate is not assimilated by any bacteria and denitrification is therefore, as opposed to uptake, referred to as **dissimilatory nitrate reduction into dinitrogen (\\(N_2\\)) and nitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\)). Ecological significance: Because of assimilation and denitrification processes, the overall nitrate concentrations in rivers tends to diminish from the catchment headwaters to the receiving bodies such as estuaries and coastal areas. As a result, inorganic nitrogen has naturally been in very short supply in these coastal water bodies, and nitrate and traditionally been the nutrient limiting aquatic productivity there. Very much like with phosphate, algae have adapted to be able to grow in very low concentrations. Anthropogenic activities, and agriculture in particular, have largely increased the loads and concentration of nitrate reaching estuaries, to the point where nitrate is no longer the limiting factor. As a result, excess nitrate is one of the reasons for the global and persistent presence of algal blooms in estuaries and coastal waters. Health hazard: There is a heated debate about the health hazard that nitrate might pose. Some argue that if anything, there might be beneficial effects, while others argue that there are evidence of cancers linked to excess nitrate absorption. Unfortunately, arguments on both sides might not be totally independent of militantism and lobbies. The only consensus everybody seems to agree upon is the Blue Baby syndrome, or methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobinemia is an unusual and potentially fatal condition in which hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin and loses its ability to bind and transport oxygen, hence the cyanosis (blue appearance) usually visible on fingers, toes, and lips. Nitrate reduced to nitrite in the body of humans and animals enters the body stream where it seems to directly oxidize oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin-peroxide complex. Picture of a Blue Baby from syndromespedia.com/blue-baby-syndrome.html Drinking water standards Although there is still a heated debate whether or not nitrate does have have detrimental health effects, the World Health Organization has provided maximum concentration guidelines of 50 mg/L as nitrate (World Health Organization 2011). These guidelines have been enacted in hard laws in the US and in Europe. The 50 mg/L as nitrate equates 11.2 mg \\(NO_3\\)-N/L and in the US, the drinking water standard is 10 mg \\(NO_3\\)-N/L. back to top 12.11.2 Nitrous Oxide Commonly known as laughing gas Nitrous oxide has significant medical uses, especially in surgery and dentistry, for its anesthetic and pain reducing effects.

The term oxidation was first used by Antoine Lavoisier to signify reaction of a substance with oxygen. Much later, it was realized that the substance, upon being oxidized, loses electrons, and the meaning was extended to include other reactions in which electrons are lost. back to top 12.12.3 Oxidation state The oxidation state (OS), or sometimes referred to as the oxidation number, quantifies the number of electrons that an atom has gained (expressed as negative charge value) or lost (expressed as positive charge value) compared to the number of valence electrons it has in its free form. As a result, it can be zero, positive or negative. For metal ions, the OS corresponds to its charge The change in oxidation state is a very powerful tool to understand the redox processes involved in the environement. But OS is less than ideal when comparing the absolute number of electrons one element has for itself For example, the nitrogen atom N, has 5 valence electrons. In the dinitrogen molecule N2, the Lewis dot structure suggests that each atom share 3 electrons with the other but essentially have 5 electrons for themselves as in Figure 12.2 Figure 12.2: Electron allocation on each of the N atom for the dinitrogen molecule N2 As a result, the number of electron on each atom equals the number of valence electrons on the free form of N, hence OS = 0. Now in the nitrous oxide case in Figure 12.3, the nitrogen atom to the left OS = 0, but for the middle Nitrogen atom, OS = -2, as two electrons were stripped by oxygen. Figure 12.3: Electron allocation on each of the N atom for the N2O molecule The problem with the oxidation state indicator is that it is a relative number, and not absolute. The electron allocation indicator that quantifies the number of electrons each atom has for itself is more abolute and thus comparable. For example, the inorganic molecule with one C atom stable in an oxidized environment is CO2, the inorganic molecule with one N atom stable in an oxidized environment is \\(NO_3^-\\), and the inorganic molecule with one S atom stable in an oxidized environment is \\(SO_4^{2-}\\). All three atoms have zero electrons for themselves as oxygen has ‘stolen’ them (Figure 12.4). So they are all potential electron acceptors that can accept up to 8 electrons. In a way they are very similar. Figure 12.4: Electron allocation on each of the C, N, and S atom for the CO2, nitrate and sulfate molecules But if one calculates the oxidation states for each of the C, N, and S atoms, for these three molecules, one would find OSC = -4, OSN = -5, and OSS = -6… We believe this can be very confusing and prefer to use the electron allocation concept as a more absolute indicator. back to top 12.13 P 12.13.1 Phosphate Phosphate is an inorganic chemical and a salt-forming anion of phosphoric acid Formula: \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) Phosphate is one of the anions of the polyprotic acid (i.e., which can liberate several protons \\(H^{+}\\)) The conjugate bases of phosphate are: All conjugate bases are related through the set acid-base chemical equilibria: \\[\\begin{align} H_3PO_4 &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; H_2PO_4^- + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 2.12}\\\\ H_2PO_4^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; HPO_4^{2-} + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 7.21}\\\\ HPO_4^{2-}&amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; PO_4^{3-} + H^+ \\tag{$pK_A$ = 12.67} \\end{align}\\] The preponderant form of phosphate in a solution also depends on the pH following this relationship: The phosphoric acid and phosphates are fully oxidized forms of inorganic molecules with just one atom of P: the Phosphorus atom has zero electrons for itself as shown in Figure 12.5 below: Figure 12.5: Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of P, including from left to right Phosphoric acid, dihydrogen Phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, and phosphate , showing that the P atoms have no electrons for themselves Production: Phosphorus in general and phosphate in practice has remained one of the nutrients limiting the most plant productivity on our planet Phosphates are the naturally occurring form of the element phosphorus, found in many phosphate minerals Phosphate minerals are mined to obtain phosphorus for use in agriculture and industry The largest global producer and exporter of phosphates is Morocco. Within North America, the largest deposits lie in the Bone Valley region of central Florida, the Soda Springs region of southeastern Idaho, and the coast of North Carolina (near Aurora). Consumption: Uptake from all primary producer including plants and algae Phosphate can also be immobilized by bacteria In food industry, phosphates help baked goods rise, they act as emulsifiers in processed cheese and canned soup, they add flavor to cola and color to frozen french fries. They also can be added to meat, poultry and seafood to help the protein bind more water, making it juicier after freezing and reheating. Ecological significance: Phosphorus as phosphate naturally is the most limiting factor for primary productivity for land and aquatic plants. Because it tends to bind to particles, phosphates have accumulated with sediment particularly in coastal areas, where phosphate can become available again to algae through sediment diagenetic processes. As a result, phosphate is generally not considered the most limiting factor for algae in estuaries and coastal environment. However, it does tend to be the limiting nutrient in freshwater receiving bodies such as lakes and reservoirs. Excess phosphate in freshwater receiving bodies has been shown to be the nutrient causing some major eutrophication problems throughout the planet back to top 12.14 R 12.14.1 Reactive nitrogen back to top 12.14.2 Redox Redox (short for reduction–oxidation reaction) is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed. Any such reaction involves both a reduction process and a complementary oxidation process, effectively allowing the electron transfer processes. 12.14.3 Redox couple redox couples, commonly noted as ‘Ox/Red’ refer to the two forms that an element might take depending on its oxidation state Ox in ‘Ox/Red’ refers to as the oxidizer or oxidizing agent, as it has the capability to make other elements lose their electrons. Red in ‘Ox/Red’ refers to as the reducer or reducing agent, as it has the capability to give electrons to other elements Common redox couples which matter in environmental and ecological engineering include: CO2/CH2O O2/H2O NO3-/N2 NO3-/NH4+ NO3-/NO2- MnO2/Mn2+ Fe3+/Fe2+ SO42-/H2S CO2/CH4 12.14.4 Redox half-reactions A half reaction is either the oxidation or reduction reaction component of a redox reaction. A half reaction is obtained by considering the change in oxidation states of individual substances involved in the redox reaction (Wikipedia contributors 2018b) Redox half reactions illustrate the transfer of electrons from the oxidized form of an element to a reduced form of an element. Half-reactions are often used as a method of balancing redox reactions To derive half-reactions, the first convention is that the oxidizer is on the left of the equation, and the reducer on the right one must first equilibrate all elements other than O and H then one balances for O, by adding H2O on the appropriate side of the half reaction then one adds the appropriate number of H+ to balance the H Finally one adds the appropriate number of e- to balance the charge. The number of e- must correspond to the change in oxidation state The half-reactions corresponding to the redox couples above are: CO2/CH2O \\[\\begin{equation} CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightleftharpoons CH_2O + H_2O \\end{equation}\\] CH2O here is a generic formula to represent the electron donating capacity of OM. This equation might be misleading as it corresponds to the OM donating 4 electrons in the respiration schemes, but because it is written using the ox/red convention, is the opposite of the intuitive direction. So a more intuitive half-reaction might be, and is effectively what is used to write the full redox reaction: \\[\\begin{equation} CH_2O + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons CO_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\end{equation}\\] O2/H2O \\[\\begin{equation} O_2 + 4 H^+ + 4 e^- \\rightleftharpoons 4H_2O \\end{equation}\\] - NO~3~^-^/N~2~ \\[\\begin{equation} 2 NO_3^- + 10 e^- + 12 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons N_2 + 6 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] - MnO~2~/Mn^2+^ \\[\\begin{equation} MnO_2 + 4 e^- + 4 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons Mn^{2+} + 2 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] - Fe^3+^/Fe^2+^ \\[\\begin{equation} Fe^{3+} + 1 e^- \\rightleftharpoons Fe^{2+} \\\\ \\end{equation}\\] - SO~4~^2-^/H~2~S \\[\\begin{equation} SO_4^{2-} + 8 e^- + 10 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons H_2S + 4 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] - CO~2~/CH~4~ \\[\\begin{equation} CO_2 + 8 e^- + 8 H^+ \\rightleftharpoons CH_4 + 2 H_2O \\end{equation}\\] a redox reaction always involves two half reactions where the electrons are transfered from the lowest redox potential couple to the highest redox potential couple. For example, the combustion of methane in oxygen involves the two O2/H2O and CO2/CH4 couples. The half-reaction of the highest redox potential couple goes on top, and that of the lowest potential at the bottom, but this time written as red/ox like in the equation below: \\[\\begin{align} 2\\,O_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^- &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; 4\\,H_2O\\\\ CH_4 + 2\\,H_2O &amp; \\rightleftharpoons &amp; CO_2 + 8\\,H^+ + 8\\,e^-\\\\ &amp; &amp;\\\\ \\hline\\\\ CH_4 + 2\\,O_2 &amp; \\to &amp; CO_2 + 2\\,H_2O \\end{align}\\] The electrons cancel out, and in this case the protons as well. So the combustion of methane, which is very simple at first glance, really involves a transfer of electrons, which the half-reactions reveal. 12.14.5 Reduction Reduction is the gain of electrons by a molecule, atom, or ion. back to top 12.15 S 12.15.1 Skeletal formula The skeletal formula, also called line-angle formula or shorthand formula, of an organic compound is a type of molecular structural formula that serves as a shorthand representation of a molecule’s bonding and some details of its molecular geometry (Wikipedia contributors 2018g). see Structural formula 12.15.2 Structural formula 12.15.3 Sulfate Sulfate is the inorganic sulfur anion stable in oxidized water Formula: \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) Sulfate 3D shape: Lewis dot structure of nitrate: Number of electron S has for itself following electronegativity rule: zero \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) can only be an electron acceptor \\(SO_4^{2-}\\) is the conjugate base of Hydrogen sulfate \\(HSO_4^{-}\\).

However, it might be a good thing to have a refresher on what electron orbitals, valence electrons, and Lewis structures are. This appendix proposes a quick refresher on these concepts. A.1.1 Electron orbitals Atoms are made of a nucleus and electrons. The nucleus itself is made of protons and neutrons. In the simplified periodic table below (Figure A.1), the first three lines of the periodic table are represented and the atomic numbers are given for each atom. The atomic number or proton number of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom. It is identical to the charge number of the nucleus. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons (Wikipedia contributors 2018l). Figure A.1: simplified periodic table that show the s and p orbitals for the first 18 atomic numbers (number of protons = number of electrons in each atom) Orbitals express the two waves and particle natures of electrons. At the bottom of each atom box in Figure A.1, one can see odd symbols like 1s2 2s22p2 for the carbon atom. The ‘s’ and ‘p’ letters represent two different electron orbitals. The numbers 1 and 2 before the letter represent the angular momentum of the orbitals, which is also an indication of the electron energy levels. An electron orbital characterizes the high probability of where an electron might be located around the nucleus. Each orbital can be occupied by a maximum of 2 electrons. The wave nature of electrons tells us that the electrons are stable, for a given energy level, in their orbitals. For the biogeochemical processes of this book, we only deal with the CHONSP atoms, which only have s, p, and d orbitals, not f, g, h, etc. What are these bizarre letters s, p, d, f, g, etc. describing orbitals anyway…? They are derived from the description by early spectroscopists of certain series of alkali metal spectroscopic lines as sharp, principal, diffuse, and fundamental&quot; (Wikipedia contributors 2018l). So now, for the low energy level 1, the orbital s appears to be a sphere. In other words the one or two atoms in this orbital will have a very high probability of being in that sphere. The one electron of hydrogen will thus be somewhere in that orbital. For helium, its two electrons will be in this sphere as well and be extremely stable. With only one electron in its orbital, hydrogen is just not very stable, and it ‘tries’ to bond with other atoms such that they can ‘share’ electrons so that the H 1s orbital is ‘visited’ by 2 electrons, which makes hydrogen ‘happy’ and stable. Now, for lithium and Beryllium, which have 3 and 4 electrons (Figure A.1), respectively, their electrons fill a new s orbital, which also is a s orbital with a spherical shape as well, just bigger as the electrons have more energy. Boron and Carbon have 5 and 6 electrons, and their orbitals are not spheres any more. The theory tells that the high probability for these electrons is to be in a space that looks like two ‘eggs’ opposed to each other (Figure A.2). These are called p orbitals. There can be 3 p orbitals which are located along three x,y,z axes with the exact same level of energy. Figure A.2: Shape of the electron orbitals s, p, d, and f. Obtained from https://chem.libretexts.org/ Electron orbitals that have the same energy levels are called degenerate orbitals. The lower energy orbitals are filled before higher energy orbitals. Hund’s rule states that degenerate orbitals are filled evenly before moving to higher energy orbitals. For p orbitals, which consist of three degenerate orbitals that all have exactly the same energy level, we put a single electron in each orbital first then put a second electron (of opposite spin, we have not mentioned spins yet, and will not here) in each orbital to fill them with a total of six electrons. Figure A.3: Hund’s rule to correctly fill in orbitals for the Carbon and Nitrogen atoms. Up and down arrows represent the electron spins. Electrons have to have opposite spins to be located in the same orbital. This has little impact for our purpose The electrons for Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur in their orbitals are represented in Figure A.4 below. you can see that, N and P, and O and S 2p and 3p orbitals, respectively, follow the same ‘filling’ patterns. Figure A.4: Hund’s rule to correctly fill in orbitals for the Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sufur atoms A.2 Orbitals hybridization This is what the theory tells us. In practice, it seems that the interactions of electrons among orbitals, and with bond atoms, make things a little different and new hybrid orbitals actually form. This is the basis of geometrical configuration of molecules and explains the shape of molecules and angles between atoms in a molecule. Does it really matter in biogeochemical processes? Actually quite a bit. Starting with the shape of the water molecule. But before then, let us explain orbital hybridization using the illustration in Figure A.5. Figure A.5: sp, sp2, and sp3 orbital hybridization and illustration for the carbon atom The electronic signature for carbon is 1s2 2s22p2. The Hund’s rule for filling orbitals suggests (Figure A.4) that one of the p orbital has no electrons. Orbital hybridization consists in moving one of the electron in the 2s orbital to fill this empty p orbital. But since electrons on the s orbital are much less energetic than the p ones, the electrons in the resulting new hybrid orbitals are not going to be as energetic. Three possible hybrid orbitals exist in nature: sp, sp2, and sp3 orbitals. For the example of carbon, there also are three orbital configurations. The lowest energy hybridization is that the 4 electrons on 2s22p2 end up in four orbitals, i.e., two in 2 sp orbitals and two in 2 p orbitals, one electron in each. This is the configuration illustrated at the bottom row, and application of this configuration is the CO2 molecule (Figure A.5). The mid energetic configuration is also four orbitals, but this time with 3 sp2 orbitals and 1 p orbital. This is the configuration illustrated at the middle row with an application being the aldehyde configuration in a molecule. The highest energy hybrid orbital is referred to as sp3, where the original 2s22p2 are hybridized into 4 sp3 orbitals, leading to a tetrahedral configuration of the orbitals, with methane being an illustration. So, the same atom can practically change its orbital configuration. And all of this depends on the molecule in which this atom is involved. This is true for all atoms, and particularly the ones we are concerned about, i.e., C, N, O, P, and S (H orbital does not change!). Since, hybridizations change depending on molecular configurations (and vice versa), it is time to recall the two types of atomic bonds prevailing in molecules of interest to us: the σ and π bonds. A.3 σ and π bonds In chemistry, sigma bonds (σ bonds) are the strongest type of covalent chemical bond. They are formed by head-on overlapping between atomic orbitals. […] A σ-bond is symmetrical with respect to rotation about the bond axis. […] Sigma bonds are the strongest type of covalent bonds due to the direct overlap of orbitals, and the electrons in these bonds are sometimes referred to as sigma electrons. (Wikipedia contributors 2018i) A covalent bond, also called a molecular bond, is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full outer shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration. (Wikipedia contributors 2018k) For the CHONSP atoms, σ bonds can be formed between s, p, and spn orbitals (Figure A.6). Figure A.6: Examples of σ bonds with different types of overlap, from s, p, and spn orbitals. Obtained freely and modified under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license pi bonds (π bonds) are covalent chemical bonds where two lobes of an orbital on one atom overlap two lobes of an orbital on another atom. The Greek letter π in their name refers to p orbitals, since the orbital symmetry of the pi bond is the same as that of the p orbital when seen down the bond axis. One common form of this sort of bonding involves p orbitals themselves. […] Pi bonds are usually weaker than sigma bonds. (Wikipedia contributors 2018h) Typically, a single bond is a sigma bond while a multiple bond is composed of one sigma bond together with pi or other bonds. A double bond has one sigma plus one pi bond, and a triple bond has one sigma plus two pi bonds. Figure A.7: Examples in the ethylene molecule of σ and π bonds. The full overlap of sp^2 orbitals between the C and H and C and C atoms leads to σ bonds and the overlap between the p orbitals leads to a π bond shown as an elongated blue lobe that extends both above and below the plane of the molecule.

Important examples of molecules where sp, sp2, and sp3 orbitals exist are presented next. Before this, it should be noted that there does not seem to be full consensus on how orbits necessarily form. The orbital hybridization is a model that explains many other observations but remains just a model. There are other models out there but this is beyond the scope of this summary. Additionally, there often are several possibilities of hybridization, and chemistry books do not necessarily agree on what hybrid orbitals atoms take in molecular arrangement. The steric number gives a nice indication on simple molecules on the hybrid orbital the central atom may take. The steric number (SN) is equal to the summation of the number of atoms bound to the central atom + the number of lone pairs left on the central atom. The lone pair can be determined using the Lewis dot structure, presented later in this chapter. The general rule for the molecules we deal with is as such: if SN = 4, the central atom follows a sp3 hybridization if SN = 3, the central atom follows a sp2 hybridization if SN = 2, the central atom follows a sp hybridization A.4 sp3 hybridization examples A.4.1 Methane Methane (SN=4+0=4) is the quintessential example of the hybridization of the Carbon 2s22p2 orbitals into 4 sp3 orbitals. The overlap of the sp3 orbitals of carbon with the 1s orbital of the hydrogen atoms form σ bonds, and create a symmetrical tetrahedral molecular shape. In aliphatic chains, the -[CH2]- are not straight but have angles between consecutive C-C bonds because of the sp3 orbitals. This is one of the reasons for the skeletal formula in organic chemistry (Figure A.8). Figure A.8: The sp3 hybrid orbitals in CH4, Modified from https://www.slideshare.net/pedagogics/2012-orbital-hybrization-sigma-and-pi-bonds A.4.2 The water molecule In the molecule of water, the oxygen (SN=2+2=4) orbitals are hybrid sp3 and two of them from two σ covalent bonds with hydrogen, leaving two sp3 orbitals as two lone pairs or electrons (Figure A.9). Figure A.9: The sp3 hybrid orbitals in H2O, leaving two lone pairs of electrons in two of the orbitals. Obtained freely under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license These lone electron pairs, opposite to the bonds with the H atoms, thus form an important electronic density, rendering the molecules asymmetric both on a geometric and on a charge basis, with the two lone pairs forming a slight electronegative side of the molecule, and the two hydrogen atoms, forming a slight electron positive side of the molecule (Figure A.10). The water molecule: is thus referred to as a polar molecule, i.e., it “has a net dipole as a result of the opposing charges (i.e. having partial positive and partial negative charges) from polar bonds arranged asymmetrically” (Wikipedia contributors 2018n) as a result, water is a good polar solvent that dissolves salts and hydrophilic organic molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, mono-, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. “Because of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four hydrogen bonds with neighboring molecules. These bonds are the cause of water’s high surface tension and capillary forces” (Wikipedia contributors 2018r). It is thanks to these capillary forces that, among other things, soils can store very significant amount of water which plants can use for their growth even during drought times. “The hydrogen bonds are also the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of other analogous compounds like hydrogen sulfide (H2S). They also explain its exceptionally high specific heat capacity (about 4.2 J/g/K), heat of fusion (about 333 J/g), heat of vaporization (2257 J/g), and thermal conductivity (between 0.561 and 0.679 W/m/K). These properties make water more effective at moderating Earth’s climate, by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere.” (Wikipedia contributors 2018r) Figure A.10: Illustration of the electric dipole of the water molecule due slight electronegativities and positivies on the O and H atoms, respectively; Hydrogen bonds are one the consequence the polar nature of water.

A.4.3 Ammonia and Ammonium Similar to water, the electron orbitals for the Nitrogen atom in NH3 (SN=3+1=4) and NH4+ (SN=4+0=4) are hybridized into sp3 orbitals. As a result the ammonia molecule has a pyramidal shape (Figure A.11), leaving a lone pair of electrons in the sp3 orbital opposite to the plan made by the H atoms. This lone pair makes ammonia a base, that is a proton acceptor to form ammonium. Similarly to water, and because of the lone pair or electron, ammonia is a polar molecule and thus has the ability to make hydrogen bonds and is thus highly miscible in water. Ammonium, the protonated form of ammonia, uses the lone pair of electrons of ammonia to create a new bond with a proton to eventually form a positively charged tetrahedral molecule, where all N-H bonds are equivalent, and polar covalent bonds. More details on the protonation of ammonia into ammonium and the equilibria is provided in the glossary. Figure A.11: Orbital configuration for ammonia, NH3. Each N–H σ-bonding orbital, containing 2 electrons, is formed from a N sp3 hybrid orbital and a H 1s orbital. The remaining lone pair of electrons occupies the fourth tetrahedral position producing a pyramidal structure. Obtained freely under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license A.4.4 Sulfate The Lewis dot structure tells us (see below) that there is 2 single bond and 2 double bonds. This makes for a total of 10 shared electrons for sulfur…?! This is possible because sulfur belongs to the third period and has d orbitals open (Figure A.12). The steric number for sulfur in the sulfate molecule (SO42-) is thus SN=4+0=4, suggesting a sp3 orbital hybridization and a tetrahedral geometrical configuration. As a result the sulfate molecule has a pyramidal shape (Figure A.12). Two of the electrons on the filled orbitals 3s and 3p move into 2 of the d orbitals. The π bonds form between the d orbitals and one p orbital of the uncharged oxygen atoms. The σ bonds from from the 4 sp3 orbitals and one p orbital of the negatively charged oxygen atoms (Figure A.12). Figure A.12: Orbital configuration for ammonia, SO42-. Each S–O σ-bonding orbital, containing 2 electrons, is formed from a S sp3 hybrid orbital and a O 2p orbital. The two π bonds are formed from the 3d orbitals and the 2p orbitals of the uncharged oxygen atoms A.4.5 Phosphate Phosphate (PO43-, SN=4+0=4) is probably one of the most fascinating molecule in the living world. Because phosphorus is in the third period of the periodic table, just as sulfur is (Figure A.1), it does not have to follow the octet rules and can accept extra electrons in the d orbitals. Theoretically, the phosphorus orbitals can be hybridized such that the 3s orbital filled with two electrons, and the 3d orbitals filled with one electron each hybridize into 5 sp3 orbitals in the molecule of phosphate. However, in the phosphate molecule, this does not happen. Instead, the hybridization generates 4 sp3 orbitals and one 3d orbitals (Figure A.4). As a result, the phosphate molecule has a tetrahedral steric configuration. Three of the Oxygen atoms gain electrons to become negative and they theoretically do not need to hybridize to from σ bonds using their p orbitals with the sp3 orbitals of the phosphorus. The π bond forms with the 3d orbital left of the phosphorus and the second open 2p orbital of the uncharged O atom. The ‘3-’ charge of the deprotonated phosphate is actually spread evenly on the four oxygen, and each phosphorus-oxygen bond can be considered have some double bond character (Figure A.13). It is the plethora of electrons on the phosphate molecule that is the basis of the storage and release of energy in the ATP molecule. Figure A.13: Orbital hybridization of Phosphorus for the phosphate molecule, and below the even spread of the π bond. Obtained with permission from https://chem.libretexts.org/ A.5 sp2 hybridization examples A.5.1 Nitrate In the nitrate molecule, the nitrogen atom (SN=3+0=3) loses an electron and becomes N+ and reconfigures its orbitals to have three sp2 and one 2p orbitals, each filled with one electron only. The nitrate molecule is thus a planar molecule. Two of the oxygen atoms gain an electron and effectively become O-. It is unclear at this point whether or not the oxygen atoms themselves reconfigure their orbitals or not… There seems to be conflicting descriptions. Most text books tend to agree that the π bond is not particularly located on one oxygen atom, but rather that each of the σ bond has an additional π like bond. The model proposed in Figure A.14 works, although the resonance among all oxygen atoms is not that straight forward in my opinion. Each of the sp2 orbital of N makes a covalent σ bond with one of the 2p orbitals of each of the oxygen. The two 2p orbitals left on both of N and O atoms form a π bond. Similar to Phosphate, the electrons of the π bond spread evenly on the three oxygen, and each nitrogen-oxygen bond can be considered to have some double bond character π bond (Figure A.14). Figure A.14: Orbital hybridization of nitrogen for the nitrate molecule, and the even spread of the π bond A.5.2 Nitrite In the nitrite molecule, the nitrogen atom (SN=2+1=3) does not need to lose an electron and reconfigures its orbitals to have three sp2 and one 2p orbitals, with one sp2 orbital filled with 2 electrons and all other orbitals filled with one electron only. One of the oxygen atoms gains an electron and effectively become O-. The model proposed in Figure A.15 works. Two of the sp2 orbital of N makes a covalent σ bond with one of the 2p orbitals of each of the oxygen. The two 2p orbitals left on both of N and O atoms form a π bond. Similar to nitrate, the electrons of the π bond spread evenly on the two oxygen, and each nitrogen-oxygen bond can be considered have some double bond character π bond (Figure A.15). Figure A.15: Orbital hybridization of nitrogen for the nitrite molecule, and the even spread of the π bond A.6 sp hybridization examples A.6.1 Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the quintessential molecule to illustrate sp hybridization. Carbon dioxide has two double bonds with oxygen, making its steric number to be SN=2+0=2. This suggests that the Carbon orbitals rearrange into 2 sp orbitals. In carbon dioxide, the oxygen atoms also rearrange into sp2 hybrids (Figure A.16), such that the two sp orbitals of the carbon form a σ bond with one of sp2 orbitals available of the oxygen atoms. Then the 2p orbitals left form π bonds together. Because of the configuration of the 2sp2p orbitals, the double bonds are at 90° of each other (Figure A.16). Figure A.16: sp orbital hybridization of carbon for the carbon dioxide molecule, and sp2 orbital hybridization of the oxygen atoms A.6.2 Dinitrogen Dinitrogen (N2) steric number is SN=1+1=2. This suggests that the Nitrogen orbitals rearrange into 2 sp orbitals. The two sp orbitals of the nitrogen form a σ bond together. Two π bonds form as the electrons in the 2p orbitals are shared among the two atoms. This is the reason for the formation of the triple bond in dinitrogen (Figure A.17). This bond is so strong that although there are two lone pairs left on each of the nitrogen atoms, which would make dinitrogen suceptible to lose these electrons, the dinitrogen molecule is mostly inert and unreactive for most metabolic pathways. This is why dinitrogen is referred to as unreactive nitrogen. The triple bond can be broken physically by lightnings, or biologically in very specialized cells such as heterocysts of cyanobacteria, or by symbiotic bacteria living in legumes or (Alnus sp.) root nodules. Figure A.17: sp orbital hybridization of nitrogen for the dinitrogen molecule and formation of the triple bond with two lone pairs left per N atom. The σ bond is formed by direct overlap of the sp orbitals and the the two π bonds by sideways overlap among the 2p orbitals (px and py) A.7 Example of no hybridization A.7.1 Dihydrogen sulfide Interestingly, dihydrogen sulfide (H2S) orbitals do not seem to follow the normal hybridization scheme described above. The steric number for the sulfur is SN=2+2=4, so it would expected that sulfur orbitals would hybridize into sp3 forms. This would then suggest that the angle between the H-S bonds would be around 109° as is the case for the very similar H2O molecule. But measurements suggest that the angle is more like 92°, closer to the 90° angle between the p orbitals (Figure A.18). Figure A.18: Direct overlap of 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms with the 3p orbitals (e.g., py and pz) of the S atom, for a final 92° angle between the H-S σ bonds. Modified from https://www.periodni.com/gallery/formation_of_h2s.png A.8 Lewis dot structures A.8.1 Valence electrons and octet rule Lewis dot structures are representation of the bonds between atoms in molecules and of the lone pairs of electrons that might be left on a particular atom. It is a very powerful tool for us as it allows to allocate the electrons in a molecule (see this Chapter). Several rules have been established to draw Lewis dot structures, which we recall here. Several terms need to be recalled here first. Valence electrons: valence electrons are the electrons that are present in the outer electronic shell of a particular atom. For C, N, and O, valence electrons are the electrons in the 2s2p shell. For S, and P, valence electrons are the electrons in the 3s3p3d outer shell. And for H, the valence electron is the one in the 1s shell. An atom with a closed shell of valence electrons (corresponding to an electron configuration s2p6) tends to be chemically inert. Atoms with one or two more valence electrons than are needed for a “closed” shell are highly reactive due to the following reasons: It requires relatively low energy to remove the extra valence electrons to form a positive ion. Because of their tendency either to gain the missing valence electrons (thereby forming a negative ion), or to share valence electrons (thereby forming a covalent bond) (Wikipedia contributors 2018q). The tendency to gain missing valence electrons to form a closed shell for the CHONSP (8 electrons for CONSP, 2 electrons for H) is called the octet rule, because each bonded atom has eight valence electrons including shared electrons. In their natural state, Hydrogen (H) has 1 valence electron is and is said to be univalent. Carbon (C) has 4 valence electrons, and as a result will tend to have 4 bonds with other atoms in a molecule. There are exceptions such as in carbon monoxide. Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) have 5 valence electrons. N will tend to form three bonds with other atoms in most cases, although it can lose an electron to form 4 bonds like in NH4+, or in N2O, and technically becomes positive. For the vast majority of our cases, P is in the form of phosphate in which P forms four σ bonds and one π bond thanks to the 3d orbital available (see phosphate). Oxygen (O) and sulfur (S) have 6 valence electrons. They will tend to form two bonds in most cases, although they can also gain one electron, become negative, and only have one single bond and a third lone pair of electrons. In the case of the sulfide ion S2-, sulfur gains two electrons and does not bond with any other atom. A.8.2 Building Lewis dot structures Several guidelines are available on chemistry books and tutorials. The one that makes the most sense to me is the technique that consists in drawing each atom with all its valence electrons, and try to build the molecule from this information. Let us take the example of nitrate. Draw all atoms with their valence electrons around them, and put the most electronegative electrons on the outside of the future molecule Draw bonds between two valence electrons for the center and outer atoms. Now, the Nitrogen atom has a lone pair of electrons and three single bonds. As it shares the electrons with oxygen, its outer shell now has eight electrons, so the octet rule is fulfilled. However, each of the oxygen only has 7 electrons so the octet rule is not fulfilled. Since there is a lone pair of electrons on the N, it is possible to share one electron of this lone pair with another electron on one of the oxygen to create a double bond. The octet rule is now fulfilled for the oxygen on the right of the diagram below. It would be tempting to do the same with the left over electron on the Nitrogen to create another double bond with another oxygen. But then, the nitrogen would have five bonds, or the equivalent of 10 shared electrons, and that would go against the octet rule. So this is not a possibility. But now, the octet rule for the Nitrogen is not fulfilled any longer, as it effectively shares 9 electrons… Because oxygen is a lot more electronegative, and nitrogen has this one extra electron left, it can ‘steal’ this electron from the nitrogen, which effectively becomes positive, but regains its octet rule, while the oxygen on the left becomes negative, and has its octet rule fulfilled. The last oxygen now still has 7 electrons total. It needs another one from somewhere. The current molecule is neutral as it N is positive and one O is negative. An extra electron has to come from elsewhere to fulfill the octet rule of the third oxygen, making this oxygen negative as well, and the whole molecule minus one negative. Well, if it is so easy to get an electron ‘from elsewhere’, why not applying this to each oxygen, to begin with like in the diagram below. This would make a NO33- which has all its octet rules fulfilled. To decide we need to introduce the important concept of formal charge. The formal charge (FC) of each atom can be calculated as: FC = (nb of valence electron) - (nb of bonds) - (nb of electrons on lone pairs) In fact, a Lewis dot structure is not complete until the formal charges on each of the atoms are added next to each of the atom. In the end, the most stable/likely molecule is the molecule for which: The formal charge will be as low as possible on each of the atoms, AND, keep the total charge of the molecule as low as possible, AND, have the most electronegative atom have the most negative formal charge. In the previous NO3- vs. NO33-, one cannot conclude among the two molecules just on the formal charges and the electronegativity criteria. However, the molecules being otherwise equal, the lower overall molecular charge of NO3- makes this form possible over the NO33- form. In the sulfate example below, three forms are possible. The octet rule for S is fulfilled for the form on the left, but because sulfur is on the third period, some electrons can be on the 3d orbitals, hence the possibility for more than 8 shared electrons like on the middle and right forms. The formal charges are higher in absolute value for the left form compared to the two others, which makes them preferable. The formal charges on the right form are equivalent to the ones on the middle form. However, in the right form, the formal charge on the lesser electronegative sulfur is lower than those on the oxygens, rendering this form unlikely as well. The probable, preferred form is thus the middle form with two single bonds, two double bonds and two oxygen atoms with a minus one negative charge. This concludes this quick reminder on minimum knowledge applicable to electron orbitals, molecular configurations, and Lewis dot structure. There are many guides and tutorials available on the web and elsewhere to complete this guide, which should be sought to confirm and verify your understanding. Below are some exercises for training purposes.
