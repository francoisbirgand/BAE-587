Complex molecules are polymers of simple monomers Each molecular family has specific structure to achieve specific function. Details of each are summarized in this chapter In organic molecules, about 4 electrons are stored on each carbon atom, none on the phosphorus, and always 8 electrons on the nitrogen and sulfur atoms 4.1 Polymers of simple monomers When scientists of the 18th century observed nature, they thought there had to be major differences between animated organisms and the inanimate ones. In fact they thought that the elements at the basis of the animated vs. inanimate things had to be different. One can only wonder at the incredible diversity and complexity of forms between a bacterium and humans, and between unicellular algae and sequoia trees! And yet, despite the incredible variations of life forms and sizes, there is a common theme: very complex organic molecules are polymers of relatively simple monomers. In the image of a brick wall and the skyscraper in Figure 4.1, it is possible to make a small wall or a huge skyscraper. Brick walls are made of bricks and of mortar to hold the bricks together. If one adds metal pieces, wood, etc. the complexity of the final product can be infinite, yet it is made from simple elementary pieces. Figure 4.1: Small and large structures can be built from the addition of bricks, one at a time Living organisms are essentially made of very complex polymers, but which are all built from simple monomers. Just like in a building which complexity results from the assemblage of different types of material, e.g., bricks, wood, metal, etc., living organisms are assembled from distinct ‘types of molecules’. Among the very complex organic polymers, one can distinguish four molecular families (in addition to what we refer to as co-enzymes), where in each family, there is a repeated pattern. A molecular family can be defined as polymers of similar monomers within a family but distinct between families a mortar or chemical bonds which binds monomers together The four molecular families that make organic molecules include: Carbohydrates Proteins Nucleic acids Lipids 4.2 Carbohydrates Carbohydrates form the entry molecules onto which electrons are first stored in photosynthesis, and precisely on the carbon atoms. The generic formula for carbohydrates is (CH2O)n, and each atom, on average, has 4 electrons for itself as illustrated in Figure 4.2. We have seen in the previous chapter that having 4 electrons stored on each C is probably the most cost effective way to store many electrons on organic molecules. Figure 4.2: Electron allocation of a generic carbohydrate (CH2O)n Carbohydrates are a rather homogeneous group as they include clearly identified monomers and polymers of these monomers. Most monomers (monolignols being a notable exception) are C6 or C5 rings and can, depending on their nature and on their polymerization type, serve very different purposes including energy storage (e.g., starch), structure (e.g., cellulose or chitin of cructacean shells), or as backbone of RNA (e.g., ribose). On an everyday life basis, carbohydrates are present in paper, sugar, pasta, grain, etc (some common carbohydrates in food illustrated in Figure 4.3). Figure 4.3: Assortment of everyday food containing carbohydrates. Obtained from https://www.measureup.com.au/all-about-carbohydrates/ 4.2.1 Monosaccharides The monomers of carbohydrates are called monosaccharides (from Greek monos, i.e., single, and sacchar, sugar) or called simple sugars or oses (from the Latin “full of, abounding in, having qualities of”). The monomers that are assembled into complex polymers generally are hexoses, that is that they have 6 carbons, and are isomers of glucose. However, monosaccharides do include more than just hexoses or C6H12O6, and it is important to present them in general, and not just the monomers of polysaccharides. Most monosaccharides are made of 3 to 6 carbons (there actually are C7 to C9 oses) and are classified in aldoses or ketoses, depending on whether they have a aldehyde (-CHO) on their C#1 or a ketone (C=O) radical, usually on the carbon numbered #2 (details on these functional groups in sections 3.2.7 and 3.2.8). They either exist in linear chains and are then represented in Fischer projection like in Figures 4.4 and 4.5, or, for pentoses (C5) and hexoses (C6), exist in cyclic chains (Figures 4.7 and 4.6). Carbohydrates have been given a lot of codes and naming conventions and it is hard to avoid them if we want to put things together. So, do not be scared by all the names and letters used to describe and differentiate carbohydrates. The goal is: to realize the large diversity of monosaccharides to realize that the differences between, e.g., the hexoses are of steric consideration, i.e., which side are the hydroxyl (-OH) groups of the linear chain, right or left. to realize that C5 and C6 carbohydrates alternate between chain and cyclic molecular configurations. The cyclic form prevails for the functions of transport and structure that the carbohydrates provide. The chain form is the form needed for the release of electrons and energy. Both forms interchange freely for monosaccharides. Figure 4.4: classification of C3 to C6 aldoses in Fischer projection. Triose : (1) D-(+)-glyceraldehyde ; Tetroses : (2a) D-(−)-erythrose ; (2b) D-(−)-threose ; Pentoses : (3a) D-(−)-ribose ; (3b) D-(−)-arabinose ; (3c) D-(+)-xylose ; (3d) D-(−)-lyxose ; Hexoses : (4a) D-(+)-allose ; (4b) D-(+)-altrose ; (4c) D-(+)-glucose ; (4d) D-(+)-mannose ; (4e) D-(−)-gulose ; (4f) D-(−)-idose ; (4g) D-(+)-galactose ; (4h) D-(+)-talose. after Yikrazuul — personal work, public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4030124 Time to incorporate some jargon. When in the chain form necessary for the carbons to donate their electrons, monosaccharides are called reducing sugars. This means that they are able to donate their electrons, to drive respiration and the generation of energy in the cell (details in Chapter 5). So, despite the fact that each carbon atom on monosaccharides has 4 electrons to give, potentially, this does not systematically happen. Strange, is it not? Indeed, for the pentoses and hexoses to be reducing sugars, they must be in the aldose form, or have a free aldehyde at the end of their chain or on carbon #1. So this rules out the ketoses? Actually no, the ketoses in the chain form can be readily tautomerized into aldoses. This is only important to explain some of the differences in disaccharides. Figure 4.5: classification of C3 to C6 ketoses in Fischer projection. Triose : (1) dihydroxyacetone ; Tetrose : (2) D-erythrulose ; Pentoses : (3a) D-ribulose ; (3b) D-xylulose ; Hexoses : (4a) D-psicose ; (4b) D-fructose ; (4c) D-sorbose ; (4d) D-tagatose. after Yikrazuul — personal work, public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6603584 You might wonder what the D-(+) or D-(-) might mean in the legends of Figures 4.4 and 4.5… This is due to optical rotation properties that a pure solution of a particular ose has because of the asymmetry of the molecules. The different forms of hexoses in, e.g., Figure 4.4 are called eniantiomers. D means that the hydroxyl group on the C#n-1 to the right of the molecule and most natural oses tend to be D (few oses have it on the left, in which case they are coded as L). The (+) or (-) tell whether the light rotation is pulled towards positive or negative angles. OK, lots of terms here, mostly to quench some of the curiosity of the biochemist in you. Now that we have a more holistic view of what monosaccharides are made of, for all our purposes, we will reduce all this great variability to a few of them, which are glyceraldehyde (C3), ribose and deoxyribose (C5), and, glucose and fructose (C6). Glyceraldehyde is an important intermediate molecule of photosynthesis. We have seen the glycerol molecule in section ??, which is a propan-tri-ol, or three hydroxyl group on each of the 3 carbons. For glyceraldehyde, an end alcohol group is oxidized to an aldehyde group. Figure 4.6: Cyclic structure or Haworth projection of alpha-D-glucopyranose (alpha-D-glucose; left) and beta-D-fructofuranose (beta-D-fructose; right) As previously mentioned, pentoses and hexoses have the tendency to form cyclic or ring molecules ‘through a nucleophilic addition reaction between the carbonyl group and one of the hydroxyls of the same molecule. The reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging oxygen atom’ (Wikipedia contributors 2018). The most common rings are made of 5 or 6 atoms, respectively with four C atoms and one O atom, and, five C atoms and one O atom (cyclic forms also referred to as furanose and pyranose, respectively, because they closely resemble furan, and pyran rings). In Figure 4.6, both glucose and fructose are hexoses. But fructose generally forms furanose rings (5 atoms, including one oxygen atom), while glucose forms pyranose rings. The α and β correspond to whether the hydroxyl on the C#1 atom is below (α) or above (β) the plan made by the ring. Some more jargon here added for exactness of information only. Figure 4.7: Cyclic structure of beta-D-Ribofuranose (beta-D-ribose) and 2-deoxyribose Ribose and deoxyribose are the most important pentoses we need to know as they constitute one of the three ensembles that constitute nucleotides, i.e., the monomers of nucleic acids. They both exist either in furanose or pyranose forms, although the furanose form dominates, but the difference between ribose and deoxyribose is the missing oxygen atom on the C2’ atom (Figure 4.7). And yes, you guessed it right, this difference is the reason for the ‘R’ and ‘D’ in the RNA and DNA molecules. Notice that the carbon atoms are numbered in Figures 4.6 and 4.7. The numbers are ‘primed’ for the ribose and deoxyribose (Figure 4.7). This is a convention that geneticians have used to differentiate the carbons from the pentose to those of the base in nucleotides (see part on nucleic acids). This is anecdotal information again. Now, as the pentoses and hexoses form rings, an interesting group appears and is referred to as the acetal group (see additional details in section 3.3.5. Yet another term needed to understand some of the subtleties of the functions of the di- and polysaccharides… For the aldohexoses to form rings, the aldehyde on carbon #1 (Figures 4.4) reacts with the hydroxyl of carbon #5 to form a 6 atom ring (e.g. for glucose on Figure 4.6). And in can easily revert to the chain structure to have a free aldehyde again and be a reducing sugar. For fructose, a ketohexose, the ketone from carbon #2, reacts with the hydroxyl of also carbon #5, to now form a 5 atom ring (Fructose on Figure 4.6). So why is this important enough to be mentioned here…? In the ring versions of the glucose and fructose, the carbons #1 and #2 now have single bonds with two oxygen atoms. This group formed by a central carbon, and bonds in a tetrahedral as illustrated in Figure 4.8 is a rather special bond. In fact, special enough that it has some interesting consequences, with two different forms. If one of the atoms bound to oxygen is different than hydrogen (e.g., R’ and R&quot; in Figure 4.8 both not H), then this group is called an acetal group, and the bond is a rather stable bond. If one of the R’ or R&quot; in Figure 4.8 is H, while the other has some other radical, then the structure becomes asymetric, the group formed is then called hemiacetal as is not nearly as stable, which explains why the hexoses so easily switch from the linear chain to the cyclic configurations. This hemiacetal group is one of the basis of the glycosidic bond, which binds the cyclic pentoses and hexoses in di- and polysaccharides, but also with other molecules. Figure 4.8: Structure of a generic acetal By NEUROtiker - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3508032 So, what is there to remember about monosaccharides? Their formula is (CH2O)n where 3 &lt; n &lt; 6 generally The C3 atom monosaccharide to remember is glyceraldehyde Small differences in the position of hydroxyl, and in the cyclisation of the C5 and C6 make for different monosaccharides Each atom has on average 4 electrons for itself, making monosaccharides the ideal molecule to store and release energy electrons, although they have to be in the aldose chain form Thanks to all the hydroxyl groups, monosaccharides are extremely soluble in water. Glucose is arguably the most important monosaccharide and the only hexose molecule you are expected to know how to draw by heart For glucose, and for organic chemistry in general, there are several ways of representing molecules. One of the ways is the Haworth projection as shown in Figures 4.6 and 4.7. Another way is called the Fischer projection as illustrated in Figures 4.4 and 4.5. Another way is called the skeletal formula where the carbons are implied at the corners and the ends of line segments, while oxygen and other remarkable radicals such as hydroxyl or amine are noted. Glucose is thus often represented as skeletal formula as in the left of Figure 4.9. Another even more simplified representation of glucose is represented in the ‘hyper’ skeletal formula. The latter has the advantage to be simple enough to be used to illustrate polysaccharides. Figure 4.9: Skeletal formula for alpha-D-glucose (left) and ‘hyper’ skeletal formula (right) 4.2.2 Dissacharides Sucrose, lactose, and maltose are three common dissaccharides. Dissacharides are bioses or polymers of two hexose monomers. Because they are still small, and thanks to their solubility in water (thanks to hydroxyl groups), they play an essential role to transport energy in chemical forms because for a slight increase of the osmotic pressure in a liquid, dissaccharides carry twice the number of electrons. Dissaccharides correspond to the assemblage of two monosaccharides thanks to the glycosidic bond. The name of this bond suggests that it is very specific to carbohydrates, and it is true as one monosaccharide must be involved in a glysidic bond. So the glycosidic bond is a type of covalent bond that joins a carbohydrate (sugar) molecule to another group, which may or may not be another carbohydrate. The common theme, however, is that the carbon of the sugar involved corresponds to that of the hemiacetal group. There are 4 types of glycosidic bonds, depending on the atom directly linked to the hemiacetal carbon of the carbohydrate: O-, N-, S-, or C-glycosidic bonds. Figure 4.10 illustrates the generic O- and N-glycosidic bond. Figure 4.10: Formation of glycosidic bonds between a hemiacetal Carbon and a hydroxyl or amine group, to respectively form O- and N-glycosidic bonds. The N-glycosidic bond occurs in nucleotides and thus plays a major role. But overall, the term glycosidic bond generally refers to the O-glycosidic bond between two consecutive monosaccharides (Figure 4.11). In the end, and to go back to the brick and mortar analogy, for di- and polysaccharides, the glycosidic bond is the equivalent of the mortar. Figure 4.11: Formation of glycosidic bonds between a glucose hemiacetal carbon and a methyl hydroxyde (top) or between two glucoses to form maltose Lactose and maltose (Figure 4.12) are dissaccharides, respectively assembled from a galactose and a glucose, and, from two glucose molecules. Notice that these two molecules are reducing sugars, i.e., there is one hemicetal carbon (C#1) free to potentially open one glucose into a chain form, hence the ability for both lactose and maltose to be readily available as electron donors. This is quite nice for lactose produced by mammal females to be readily available for their offsprings. On another note, during seed germination, starch (details below) is hydrolyzed into maltose first by the amylase enzyme, and then readily participate in energy generation for this critical time of seed plant lives. Figure 4.12: Lactose and maltose dissaccharides molecular formulae Interestingly, sucrose in not a reducing sugar as both hemiacetal carbons (C#1 of glucose, and C#2 of fructose) are part of the glycosidic bond (Figure 4.13). There are several advantages: Figure 4.13: Sucrose molecular formula Sucrose is a very stable molecule, and a lot more than lactose and maltose. Hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond is very slow and solutions of sucrose can last for a very long time. Because both hemiacetal carbons are bound, there are no more possibilities for an additional glycosidic bond to take place: sucrose stays as a dissaccharide This is actually essential for green vascular plants, which assemble sucrose in their leaves from glucose and fructose, but must transport these molecules away from the leaves to minimize weight and avoid jamming of the photosynthesis. So having a very stable, highly soluble, not polymerisable, non reducing molecule is very advantageous. Sucrose can then be hydrolyzed thanks to the sucrase enzyme into glucose and fructose again for use or storage at other places in the plants. So what is there to remember? The glycosidic bond always involves one hemiacetal group and is the key to for carbohydrate di-mers, and also poly-mers Dissacharides are small molecules which are easily soluble and easily transportable. For the a very similar osmotic pressure, dissaccharides carry twice as many electrons as monosaccharides: dissaccharides are the ‘go to’ transport molecules Sucrose is a non reducing sugar, which allows transportation of a precious cargo in sap very far from where it was produced (think about sequoias!) 4.2.3 Polyssaccharides or glycans Polysaccharides are polymers of monosaccharides linked together thanks to the glycosidic bond, forming sometimes very long chains (at least more than 10 monosaccharides, or else are referred to oligosaccharides), either linear or branched. The polysccharide chains are also referred to as glycans, the suffix an implying a chain of monosaccharides. In glycan, the prefix glyc refers to the generic carbohydrate. The term glucan refers to a chain of glucose monomers, similarly, the term xylan, refers to a chain of xylose monomers, and so on. Polysaccharides generally have two main functions: energy storage or structure. Because of the glycosidic bond, which removes a molecule of H2O, the general formula for a large polysaccharide is more like (C6H10O5)n often with 200 &lt; n &lt; 3500. For our purpose, it is important to remember that there are three main polysaccharides: homopolysaccharides or homoglycans, i.e., long chains of the same monomers (homo: same), and heteropolysaccharides or heteroglycans, long chains of a variety of monomers (hetero: different), generally separated into hemicelluloses and pectins. 4.2.3.1 Homopolysaccharides or homoglycans Among the most important homopolysaccharides, one can distinguish starch and glycogen, which are both energy storage molecules for plants, and animals, respectively, and, cellulose which has a structure function making a lot of the plants cell walls (Figure 4.14). Figure 4.14: Starch, glycogen, and cellulose are the three main homopolysaccharides of importance for our field. Obtained from https://www.sedelco.org/cms/lib/PA01001902/Centricity/Domain/506/05_Lecture_Presentation.pdf All three molecules are polymers of α- and β D-glucoses. Starch is a polymer of α-D-glucoses linked together by carbons 1 and 4. Glycogen has essentially the same structure, although it has some branches thanks to a bound between carbon 1 and 6 (Figure 4.15). Figure 4.15: Illustration of the 1-4 links between monomers of alpha-D-glucose for starch, plus 1-6 links to form branches for glycogen, and 1-4 links between monomers of beta-D-glucose for cellulose. Obtained from https://biochemikages005.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/carbohydrates/ Before we go on on describing the molecular structure of polysaccharides, it is time to reflect on their significance at the planet scale. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on earth (Klemm et al. 2005). Thanks to the hydrogen bonds between adjacent β-D-glucose polymers, very strong cellulose microfibrils form, themselves bundled into macrofibrils, surrounded by hemicelluloses and lignin (Figure 4.16). Cellulose molecules can be hydrolyzed thanks to the cellulase enzyme, generally secreted by bacteria, although animals such as termites do produce a cellulase. Most mammals only have a limited ability to digest cellulose fibers, and even ruminants and monogastric herbivores use symbiotic bacteria to produce cellulase. Figure 4.16: Illustration of Cellulose strands surrounded by hemicellulose and lignin in plant cell walls (Department of Energy’s Genomic, 1986). So if cellulose is the most abundant molecule on earth, one needs to pause in the structure description of polysaccharides and locate where polysaccharides play a role. Cellulose is the basic structure of plant cell walls. Plant cells, are distinctively different from animal cells because of their cell wall. It is the resemblance with honeycomb cells that Robert Hooke coined the term cell for plants in 1665, the shape being well defined and distinctive thanks to the walls. The cell wall is located externally to the plasma membrane and is synthesized by the cell itself. Morphologically, the cell wall is formed by layers or sheets. All cells have at least two: middle lamella and primary wall. The middle lamella is synthetized and shared by cells that are contiguous with each other, while the primary cell wall is synthetized and belongs to each cell. In some plant cells, a third thicker layer called secondary cell wall is deposited between the membrane and the primary wall. Most of the wood in the trees correspond to the secondary cell wall (Figure 4.17) (Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego 2013) Figure 4.17: Illustration of plant cell walls. Obtained from the Atlas of Plant and Animal Histology (Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego 2013). The outermost layer of the cell wall and the first to form is the middle lamella. It acts as a glue that binds neighboring cells. The middle lamella consists mainly of pectins, although it can be lignified in those cells that have a secondary cell wall. The primary wall consists mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins, glycoproteins. For the cells that have one, the secondary wall consists mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignins (Figure 4.18; Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego 2013; Loix et al. 2017). Figure 4.18: Illustration of the glycans structure of plant cells with primary wall only (A), and plant cells with both primary and secondary walls (B) (Loix et al. 2017). Of these different classes, only cellulose is well defined, consisting entirely of β-(1→4)-linked glucan chains. Pectin are highly heterogeneous polysaccharides, traditionally characterized by being relatively easily extracted with hot acid or chelators and by containing a large amount of galacturonic acid residues. Hemicelluloses traditionally comprise the remaining polysaccharides […] (Scheller and Ulvskov (2010)) 4.2.3.2 Pectins Pectins are heteroglycans based on galacturonans, or polygalaturonic acids, i.e. polymers of galacturonic acid monomers. For comparison purposes, the difference between glucose and galacturonic acid are illustrated in Figure 4.19 below. The alcohol functional group of glucose on C6 is oxidized into a carboxylic acid group, and the hydroxyl on C4 changes side. The main role of pectin is to give physical strength to the plant and to provide a barrier against the outside environment (Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller 2010). Pectins also hold cells together. Fruit ripening (becoming softer) or leaf fall, are in part due to the decomposition of pectins by pectinase enzymes. Pectins also seem to play a role during seed germination, and as such also have an energy storage role, particularly thanks to the galactans and arabinans (Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller 2010; Scheller and Ulvskov 2010) Figure 4.19: Illustration of the differences between alpha-D-glucose and D-galacturonic acid monomers. Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller (2010) classify pectins in four categories (Figure 4.20): the homogalacturonans (HG), which are relatively homogeneous galacturonans, although some acetyl (-CH2-CH3) or methyl (-CH3, more details herein) groups can be added. These are the most abundant, ~65% (Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller 2010) the xylogalacturonans (XGA), for which some xylose monomers are added to the the galacturonan chain thanks to the glycosidic bonds. XGA appear to be minor components of pectins. the Rhamnogalacturonans II (RGII), which still hold the galacturonan as the basic chain, but with complicated carbohydrate chains, containing rhamnose monomers in particular. RGII appear to be minor components of pectins. and the Rhamnogalacturonans I (RGI), for which rhamnose monomers alternate between galacturonic acids and that side carbohydrate side chains of arabinans and galactans. RGI constitute between 20-35% of the pectins. Figure 4.20: Illustration of the general types of pectins. Notice that the common structure or pectin backbone (but for RGI) is the polymer of galacturonic acids, or galacturonan, to which, quite a diversity of monomers participate resulting in the large heterogeneity of these heteroglycans (Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller 2010). Again, this information is provided to expose readers to the extraordinary diversity of carbohydrates, and are not meant to be known in great details. It is important to remember that in addition to homoglycans, there are galactorunans, on which pectins are bases. 4.2.3.3 Hemicelluloses Hemicelluloses are heteroglycans or heteropolysaccharides. The hemicellulose term was coined at a time when the structures were not well understood and biosynthesis was completely unknown. Hemicellulose is recognized as a group of wall polysaccharides that are characterized by being neither cellulose nor pectin and by having β-(1→4)- linked backbones of glucose, mannose, or xylose (Figure 4.21). These glycans all have the same equatorial configuration at C1 and C4 and hence the backbones have significant structural similarity (Scheller and Ulvskov 2010). For those of you who are curious about the ‘equatorial configuration’ term used here, this has to do with the steric configuration of the hydroxyl groups in the cyclic configuration of monosaccharides. This was not even introduced in this chapter, although it is an important consideration for chemists to characterize carbohydrates! Figure 4.21: Illustration of the general types of hemicelluloses, which vary among species and plant groups. Notice the nomenclatures ending in -an, suggesting polysaccharides. OMe, represents methyl groups; Ac, represents acetyl groups; “Fer” represents esterification with ferulic acid (3-methoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) (after Scheller and Ulvskov 2010). The most important biological role of hemicelluloses is their contribution to strengthening the cell wall by interaction with cellulose microfibrilsand, in some walls, with lignin (e.g., Figure 4.17). All the hemicelluloses show differences in structural details between different species and in different cell types within plants (Figure 4.21). 4.2.3.4 Lignins Lignin (from the latin lignum, meaning wood) is, after cellulose, the second most abundant terrestrial biopolymer, accounting for approximately 30% of the organic carbon in the biosphere. The ability to synthesize lignin has been essential in the evolutionary adaptation of plants from an aquatic environment to land. Lignin is crucial for structural integrity of the cell wall and stiffness and strength of the stem. In addition, lignin waterproofs the cell wall, enabling transport of water and solutes through the vascular system, and plays a role in protecting plants against pathogens (Boerjan, Ralph, and Baucher 2003). It is thought that it is the multiple aromatic rings of the phenylpropanoids that provide the stiffness of lignin, hence of wood. Figure 4.22: Three common monolignols, monomers for the lignin molecules: paracoumaryl alcohol (1), coniferyl alcohol (2) and sinapyl alcohol (3) By Yikrazuul - Own work, Public Domain Lignins are polymers of a lot more complex monomers than the monosaccharides presented earlier. The monomers of lignin are called monolignols. Nothing to be scared of, because there is no expectation for the reader to know them! Technically, the lignin monomers are generally referred to as phenylpropanoids (which means that there is a phenol radical attached to a propane like C3 structure). The suffix -oid means pseudo), and technically derived from hydroxycinnamyl alcohol differing in their degree of methoxylation, p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols (Figure 4.22). Figure 4.23: Illustration of the diversity of monomers and polymer units present in lignins (Boerjan, Ralph, and Baucher 2003) When introduced in the lignin polymer the corresponding monolignols are named guaiacyl (G), sinapyl (S), and hydroxyl-coumaroyl (H) units, respectively (Figure 4.23). The G, S, and H abbreviation letters are often used in the lignin literature. For example, the composition of lignin varies between plant species and tissues. In general, lignins from gymnosperms and related species (called softwood in English) are rich in G units and contains low amounts of H units, whereas lignins of angiosperm dicotyledons (flowing plants with reticulate or network-like leaf veins) are mainly composed of G and S units (corresponding to hardwood in English). For references only and to have some awareness of the diversity of the monomers and polymer units, Figure 4.23 has been added above. An example of a possible lignin structure is illustrated in Figure 4.24. It shows the great complexity of this second most important molecule on earth after cellulose. Figure 4.24: An example of a possible lignin structure. The portion shown here has 28 monomers (mostly coniferyl alcohol), 278 carbon atoms, 407 hydrogen atoms, and 94 oxygen atoms. Karol Głąbpl.wiki On an interesting note, it has recently been shown that polymerization of the monolignols is not random, but that monolignols are first assembled into lignol dimers (two monolignols), referred to as lignans. Lignans are thus dehydrodimers of monolignols (Davin et al. 1997; reviewed in Wang et al. 2013). There seems to be a plethora of lignans in nature, but exploring the literature on these reveals that some lignans, after ingestion by mamals may have anti-cancer properties! For the record and in case you are fascinated by how things are connected, some of the names and structures of these lignans are rather indicative of where they have been found or associated. For example in Figure 4.25, you can see that one of them is called pinoresinol, suggesting links with pine and resin. Another one is called lariciresinol. Larix is the genus name of the larches tree in English. Another one secoisolariciresinol, the prefix secoi-, likely having to do with sequoia, and so on. Podophyllotoxin at the left bottom is found in the toxic American mandrake, or ground lemon plant, but also on some flax seeds, and seems to be an interesting anti-oxidant for colon cancer (Fuss 2003). Figure 4.25: Hypothetical biosynthetic pathway leading from coniferylalcohol to podophyllotoxin showing a variety of lignans or lignol dimers used in the biosynthesis of lignin, but also having antioxidant properties beneficial for the health of mammals (Fuss 2003) 4.2.4 Other important carbohydrates It would be erroneous to leave out some additional mono- or polyssaccharrides out as some of them play a very significant role in biology and ecology. In a way, they correspond to the exceptions that confirm or rather complete the rule. So far, we have summarized monosaccharides with the general formula (CH2O)n, to essentially be mostly C5 and C6 molecule where the average carbon is bonded to an hydroxyl functional group and a hydrogen atom. And that these monosaccharides have the tendency to form 5 or 6 atom rings. Well, it turns out that on this general configuration, some of the hydroxyl groups are replaced by other functional groups. The most famous one is probably is deoxybose, as it replaces ribose, as already mentioned above and illustrated again below (Figure 4.26). Figure 4.26: Replacement of a hydroxyl group of ribose by hydrogen, effectively removing an oxygen atom or ‘deoxy-ing’ the ribose, hence the formation of deoxyribose Several others that need mentioning are illustrated below. The first one is glucosamine where carbon number 2 has been replaced by an amine group. Glucosamine is a precursor of glycosylated proteins and lipids (glycosylated means that a sugar is linked with a protein/lipid other substituent via a glycosidic bond). When an acetyl group is added to the amine group of a glucosamine (via an amide bond), the resulting carbohydrate is called N-acetylglucosamine (Figure 4.27). Figure 4.27: Important additional monosaccharides where the hydroxyl group has been replaced by an amine and an N-acetylamine Two of these bonded via a glycosic bond form the monomer for chitin (Figure 4.28), i.e., the polysaccharide forming the exoskeleton of arthropods, such as crustaceans and insects, the radulae of molluscs, cephalopod beaks, and the scales of fish and lissamphibians [Wikipedia contributors (2019b); Figure 4.29]. Figure 4.28: N-acetylamine dimer forming the basis for the chitin polysaccharide that serves as exoskeleton of many invertebrates The exoskeleton of these macroinvetebrates possesses excellent mechanical properties in terms of stiffness-todensity ratio and fracture toughness (Nikolov et al. 2011). This is explained by the microstructure of the exoskeleton, and how the chitin nanofibrils are put together (Figure 4.29). Figure 4.29: Exoskeleton of the American lobster (Homarus americanus) formed by seven levels of microstrucutures of the nanofibrils of chitin, polysaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine (Nikolov et al. 2011) Deoxygenation of the alcohol group of carbon 6 of glucose yields quinovose or 6-deoxyglucose (Figure 4.30). The methyl radical can become sulfanated by a sulfo- radical, to yield sulfoquinovose. Sulfoquinovose is one of the backbone sugars for glycolipids that form the innermembrane of thylakoids in chloroplasts (more details in section 4.3.5.3). The molecule quinovose is a sugar moiety of the quinovin molecule, extracted from the bark of the tree of the cinchena genus in South America. The local Quechuan name is kina, and the new kina, is a quina nova, hence the word quinovin by contraction. And the sugar or ose of the quinovin is thus named a quinovose. Figure 4.30: Glucose, quinovose, and sulfoquinovose as important monosaccharides used as building blocks for glycolipids forming the inner membranes of thylakoids in chloroplasts Lastly, carbohydrates play a major role in the communication between cells as carbohydrates small chains are often attached to membrane proteins and lipids, in which case proteins and lipids are referred to as glycoproteins and glycolipids, respectively (more details below). Learning outcomes at the end of this section on carbohydrates, you should be able to: Monosaccharides: Their formula is (CH2O)n where 3 &lt; n &lt; 6 generally The C3 atom monosaccharide to remember is glyceraldehyde Small differences in the position of hydroxyl, and in the cyclisation of the C5 and C6 make for different monosaccharides Each atom has on average 4 electrons for itself, making monosaccharides the ideal molecule to store and release energy electrons, although they have to be in the aldose chain form Thanks to all the hydroxyl groups, monosaccharides are extremely soluble in water. Glucose is arguably the most important monosaccharide and the only hexose molecule you are expected to know how to draw by heart 4.3 Lipids Lipids are fatty acids and their derivatives, and substances related biosynthetically or functionally to these compounds (Christie 1987). The scientific term “lipid” comes from the Greek “lipos” which referred to animal fat or vegetable oil. Lipids are mainly made of C and H atoms, but do also contain O, N, and P. So it is important to remember that lipids are made of CHONP. Lipids are a very heterogeneous group of molecules and are defined in part from their propensity to be soluble in non-polar solvents (no net dipole as a result of the opposing charges in the solvent molecules). In other words, lipids do not (or not easily) dissolve in water. Contrary to carbohydrates, proteins, or nucleic acids, lipids are not obvious polymers of identified and clearly defined monomers. Rather, lipids are assemblages of well identified building blocks and backbones bonded together with ester, ether, and amide bonds. There are two main types of building blocks resulting in two major types of lipids: lipids built from fatty acid blocks (acyl groups) and lipids based from sterol blocks (ringed isoprene groups). Because there is no polymerization, lipids are relatively small molecules compared to polysaccharides, proteins, or nucleic acids. Figure 4.31: Common everyday ingredients containing lipids. (obtained from http://blesslaboratory.com/index.php/services/oil One of the main differences between carbohydrates and lipids is that the carbons of lipids are generally a lot more reduced (have more electrons for themselves) than the carbohydrates. For the latter, there are just about as many oxygen atoms as there are carbons, as a legacy of how they are formed during photosynthesis (details in chapter 6). Because of the number of oxygen atoms and their reactivity, carbohydrates are only able to form relatively short 5 and 6 carbon monomers, which tend to readily assemble into rings. Polymerization is what allows carbohydrates to form very large molecules. Lipids aliphatic chains have relatively few oxygen atoms instead, and always strategically located near the ends of the chains. Consequently, the carbons of the hydrocarbon chains are not as prompt to react together. The result is that it becomes possible to have longer hydrocarbon molecules, which can also be relatively straight (e.g., fatty acids), or as in sterol form almost saturated rings. These long aliphatic chains are the reasons for the mostly hydrophobic character of lipids (Figure 4.31). However, the fatty acid-based lipids are amphipathic (also referred to as amphiphilic), i.e., that they have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends. The hydrophobic end or hydrophobic tail corresponds to the long aliphatic chain of the fatty acid residue. The hydrophilic end or hydrophilic head is associated with ionic and polar groups that include ester and amide bonds, the backbone, and other polar radicals (details below). The amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles, multilamellar/unilamellar liposomes, or membranes in an aqueous environment (Wikipedia contributors 2019a). Overall, lipids function as essential structural components of membranes, as signalling molecules, as chemical identifiers of specific membranes and as energy storage molecules (Meer, Voelker, and Feigenson 2008). Thousands of lipid molecules have been listed and an entire scientific discipline called lipidomics is dedicated to lipids structure and function! Rigorous classifications have been proposed (e.g., Fahy et al. (2005), Fahy et al. (2009)), and a gateways on lipid research and updates are available (e.g., lipidmaps) . Our goal here is to present enough of what lipids are and do. Overall lipids may be divided into eight categories: fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides (derived from condensation of acyl subunits); and sterol lipids and prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits) (Wikipedia contributors 2019a) 4.3.1 Overview of fatty acid- or acyl-based lipids In this category, are included fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, saccharolipids, and sphingolipids. They all have in common the presence of long aliphatic carbon chains forming ‘tails’ of the molecules. The average carbon of a fatty acid chain is a methylene (-CH2-) such that each carbon atom has 6 electrons for itself (Figure 4.32). Consequently, lipids are, among the macromolecules, those which can store and release the most energy per carbon atom! Figure 4.32: Electron allocation of a generic fatty acyl group (CH2)n. The group -CH2- is referred to as a methelene group Lipids share with nucleic acids the ‘building block’ structure, in that they are built of identified building blocks. The quintessential acyl-based lipid is made of two fatty acids forming the hydrophobic tail end, a backbone, a phosphate or hexose, and a polar group. The three latter building blocks form the hydrophilic head, which tends to be a lot shorter than the hydrophobic end unlike illustrated in Figure 4.33 below. Figure 4.33: Schematic of the quintessential fatty acid based lipid illustrating the amphipathic nature, and the different building blocks From this simple construction, thousands of acyl-based lipid molecules exist following a wide variation on the fatty acids themselves, the three types of backbones, and on the polar groups (nature and number). And there are lots of exception to this general rule (e.g., Fahy et al. 2005, 2009). Nonetheless, Figure 4.34 summarizes how acyl-based lipids are constructed and how some of the classification has been derived. It reads from the bottom to top. The first stage of molecules having only one of the building blocks are the fatty acids. There are so many of them that they are classified as a lipid group by themselves. Figure 4.34: The main types of fatty acid based lipids: illustrating the common fatty acid base, and resulting from the three types of backbones and a variety of polar groups making the hydrophilic head) The second stage molecules are lipids built from fatty acids + a backbone. The backbone molecules can bind with one to three fatty acids on one side, with ester or amide bonds, and with other radicals on the other side allowing more building blocks to be added. There are three main backbone molecules: glycerol, hexosamine (glucosamine in Figure 4.34), and sphingosine. Mono-, di- and triacylglycerols (previously called mono-, di-, and triglycerides, respectively) play such an important role in metabolism and energy storage, that the glycerolipids have been identified as a group of its own. Glycerolipids with additional building blocks eventually lead to the glycerophospholipid family (green in Figure 4.34). The glucosamine (hexose with an amine group) eventually leads to the saccharolipid family (blue in Figure 4.34). Sphingosine plays both the role of a backbone and of a fatty acid thanks to its long aliphatic tail. Sphingosine-based lipids eventually lead to the sphingolipid family (grey in Figure 4.34). The third stage are lipid molecules built from fatty acids + a backbone + phosphate or a sugar. It is quite interesting to realize that only two molecules, phosphate or an hexose, play that role. They have enough hydroxyl functional group to make ester bonds with other groups. Most glycerophospholipids have a fourth stage of building blocks, and the third stage is thus an intermediate form. Many glycolipids and sphingolipids only have stage three molecules and are incorporated into cell membranes as such. The fourth stage are lipid molecules with four building blocks: fatty acids + a backbone + phosphate or a sugar + polar group. These molecules make about 50% of the cell membranes and thus play a major role in life. It is the amphipathic nature of these molecules that leads them to readily assemble into acyl lipid bilayers (generally referred to as phospholipids). The hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads tend to aggregate together forming a layer or sheet of molecules a bit like a bundle of wheat bouquet. Because cells essentially are aqueous systems, the hydrophobic side of the layer is naturally unstable, unless it is stabilized by another layer of phospholipids, with the hydrophobic tails facing each other and the hydrophilic heads facing the aqueous phase of the cell (more details later). Third and fourth stage acyl-based lipids all have similar features: they have a hydrophobic tail group, and a hydrophyllic head group. As a result, they tend to naturally congregate together to form the famous lipid bilayer in which proteins and glycoproteins, serving as cell receptors, catalyzers, or exchange regulators can readily embed. Time to pause in the strict biochemical description of acyl-based lipids, and spend some time to introduce an overview of the function of these lipids in cell membranes. And maybe, the description of these will be more fascinating later on. 4.3.2 Lipids as key to cell membrane structure and function In this section, lots of concepts are thrown at the reader, whom might be a bit rebuted by so many apparently complicated names (although most of them appear in Figure 4.34). I decided to present the membrane function first in hope of making the biochemical description of enough of the lipids more interesting. So no worries, read this as a fascinating introduction to the wonders of life! The first important concept to grasp is that in the lipid bilayer, the adjacent lipid molecules are not bonded together. It is thanks to their hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, and to a lesser degree thanks to hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions, that the membrane lipids stay together and that cellular membranes exist altogether. The membrane does not have a solid crystalline nature, but rather a more fluidic nature, where molecules can freely move about within their layer or sheet. Proteins can insert themselves into this bilayer system thanks to the fluidic behavior. They too must have some amphipathic properties as well with hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends. Because proteins are inserted in a mosaic pattern, the fluidic mosaic model proposed in 1972 [Singer and Nicolson (1972); Figure 4.35] is the accepted model to describe membrane bilayer. Figure 4.35: The fluidic mosaic model as published by Singer and Nicholson (1972). The filled circles represent the ionic and polar head groups of the phospholipid molecules, which make contact with water; the wavy lines represent the fatty acid chains which make contact which each other. The integral proteins are shown as globular molecules partially embedded in, and partially protruding from, the membrane The second important concept is that the diversity of membrane lipids and their layout and interactions together allow the concurrent formation of fluidic and more rigid areas in the membrane itself corresponding to different phases. The two main phases are the liquid disordered phase, very fluidic, almost liquid, and the liquid ordered phase, more gel-like and more rigid. The liquid disordered phase is a highly fluid state in which individual lipids can move laterally across the surface of the membrane relatively unhindered. Liquid-disordered bilayers are often characterized by irregular packing of individual lipid molecules, as well as the presence of kinks in unsaturated fatty acids. These kinks effectively reduce the surface area accessible to other fatty acid chains, weakening van der Waals interactions (Membrane Phase Transitions, libretext). When the fatty acid chains are more fully extended because they are more saturated, and/or because they interact with sterols (details below), they become more fully packed and the van der Waals interactions are increased. They yields to a more rigid gel-like structure referred to as the liquid ordered phase. And guess what, this is where the proteins are also located and this makes sense because they have a more rigid structure in which to stay (Figure 4.36). Figure 4.36: Membranes show a lipidic bilayer structure with lateral heterogeneity. Some lipids associate to form more dense areas known as membrane nanodomains or lipid rafts. In these domains, some proteins are included more frequently by electrochemical affinity. Cholesterol is located among the fatty acid chains, close to hydrophilic heads of the lipids, straighten fatty acids, and provide more rigidity to the membrane. Transmembrane proteins allow communication between extracellular and intracellular environments. Carbohydrates are found in the outer monolayer of the cell membrane forming the so-called glycocalyx. In this figure, the interactions of cell membrane molecules with cytoskeleton and with extracellular matrix are not depicted [Figure and caption after Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego (2013) and Artur Jan Fijałkowski In other words, the number of unsaturated bonds in the fatty acid chains have a major impact on how fluidic the membrane is. The more unsaturated, the more kinks, and the more fluidic the membrane. Reversely, the more saturated, the less kinks, the more packed the hydrophobic tails, and the less fluidic the membrane. The addition of sterol lipids tends to generate the more rigid liquid ordered phase (Figure 4.37), and these tend to be present where the proteins are embedded in the membrane (Figure 4.36 and 4.38). Figure 4.37: Liquid-order and liquid-disorder phases in membranes due to the level of saturation of fatty acids and interactions with cholesterol and transmembrane interactions. AP- anchored protein (after Harayama and Riezman (2018)) The aggregations of lipids around proteins are referred to as membrane rafts (or lipid rafts) or membrane nanodomains (Simons and Ikonen 1997; Edidin 2003) (Figure 4.36 and 4.38). And the lipids that give the liquid ordered phase around proteins tend to include sphingolipids and cholesterols (Simons and Ikonen 1997; Ahmed, Brown, and London 1997; Hooper 1999; Varma and Mayor 1998; Edidin 2003; Toulmay and Prinz 2013; Schmidt and Davis 2017; Sezgin et al. 2017; Harayama and Riezman 2018), phosphatidylserine and cholesterol, and phosphatidylinositol, which thanks to their long aliphatic chains tend to interact from across the membrane (Figure 4.37). An entire symposium on membrane raft generated this definition which highlights the importance of special lipids and their interactions with cholesterol: Membrane rafts are small (10–200 nm), heterogeneous, highly dynamic, sterol- and sphingolipid-enriched domains that compartmentalize cellular processes. Small rafts can sometimes be stabilized to form larger platforms through protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions (Pike 2006). Figure 4.38: a | Lipid raft domains are usually defined as small, highly dynamic and transient plasma membrane entities that are enriched in saturated phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycolipids, cholesterol, lipidated proteins and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. Enrichment of these hydrophobic components endows these lipid domains with distinct physical properties; these include increased lipid packing and order, and decreased fluidity. In addition to membrane components, cortical actin plays an active part in domain maintenance and remodelling. Furthermore, membrane lipids are asymmetrically distributed in the inner and outer leaflets, which may further affect membrane organization. b | It is likely that membrane organization is not binary (that is, highly distinct raft and non-raft regions), but instead membranes consist of various raft-like and non-raft domains with distinct compositions and properties. (Figure and caption from Sezgin et al. 2017) The third important concept is to realize that in addition to lateral heterogeneity around membrane nanodomains, the membrane lipids assemblage is asymetric between the inner and outer leaflets of the membrane (reviewed by Harayama and Riezman (2018); Figure 4.39). The very nature of the membrane lipids leads to a cylindrical shape, a conical shape, or inverted-conical shapes. When assembled together, these shape allow for membrane curvature and fission (Figure 4.39). Additionally, some membrane lipids such as PhosphatidylSerine (PS), because of the serine (an amino acid) group as the polar group, tends to bind with cytoplasm proteins like actin (considered to be the cytoskeleton, or the skeleton that keeps animal cells together). As a result, PS tends to be on the inner leaflet of the membrane. Figure 4.39: The shape of the different membrane acyl-based lipids leads to curvature of a membrane leafet, and the overall bilayer membrane results in part from the asymetric layout of the membrane lipids. SM - SphingoMyelin, PC - PhosphatidylCholine, CHOL - Cholesterol, PS - PhosphatidylSerine, PE - PhosphatidylEthanolamine, PE-O - PhosphatidylEthanolamine with ether bonds (after Harayama and Riezman (2018) and Skotland and Sandvig (2019)) It was impossible to leave this section about membranes without providing what is considered a realistic representation of what a membrane might look like reality. In other words, things are a lot more complex than our brain can fully handle! Figure 4.40: Glimpse at the near future: model of the plasma membrane in full complexity. Featuring: a lipid bilayer composed of hundreds of different lipids, crowded with a large variety of embedded as well as peripherally bound proteins, a supporting actin skeleton, a cytoplasmic site full of proteins, and realistic gradients of metabolites, ions, and pH (Figure and caption from Marrink et al. 2019) 4.3.3 Fatty acids: lipids of their own and primary common building blocks Fatty acid are carboxylic acids with a long aliphatic chain (synonymous to long hydrocarbon chain or alkyl chain), which are either saturated (e.g., palmitic acid in Figure 4.41), mono-, or poly-unsaturated (i.e., there are at least one double bond between two consecutive carbon atoms, as illustrated in Figure 4.41; more details in section 3.1.2). The double bond in the aliphatic chain is rigid and can create ‘kinks’ in the 3D shape. Most fatty acids in nature have even number of carbons and range from 10 to 22 carbon atoms. Figure 4.41: Examples of saturated fatty acids (palmitic and stearic acids), mono-unsaturated oleic acid, and poly-unsaturated fatty acids exhibiting ‘kinks’, which when part of a membrane lipids, participate in the fluidic nature of the membrane. Sphingosine technically is not a fatty acid but is illustrated to show that it is straight like a saturated fatty acid. In XX:Y, XX corresponds to the number of carbon atoms, and Y corresponds to the number of unsaturated bonds. ω-3 means that the last unsaturated bond is at 3 carbons from the end (red font). The blue numbers correspond to the carbon number from the carboxyl end. Further explanation in the text below Fatty acids have been classified according to their carbon-chain length and their level of saturation. According to their length, Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) have aliphatic chains with less than 6 carbon atoms. Even acetic acid (CH2COOH, acid of the vinegar) is classified in this category; so is butyric acid (C4) present in butter. Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6 to 12 carbons, which can form medium-chain triglycerides. Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 13 to 21 carbons. These are the typical molecules to which the generic term is often associated. Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are fatty acids with 22 or more carbons. VLCFA can represent up to a few percent of the total fatty acid content of a cell. Fatty acids are then classified depending on whether they are saturated, mono- or polysaturated, but also whether there are some methyl, cyclic, hydroxyl, or nitro radicals in their chains, to name a few. This is way beyond the purpose of this book but many details can be found on the LipidWeb maintained by Dr. Christie or classified by Fahy (2005, 2009). In addition to being precursors of other lipids, fatty acids have their own metabolic role. For humans, many fatty acids play essential roles in, e.g., brain activities, cellular messengers, or have been identified to have health benefits. Two fatty acids are considered essential fatty acids for humans, i.e., that humans need them but lack the ability to synthesize them (Figure 4.42). Figure 4.42: α-linolenic acid (omega-3 acid) and linoleic acids (omega-6 fatty acid) are the two essential polyunsaturated fatty acids humans must ingest for their metabolic needs The Alpha Linoleic Acid (ALA) is an omega-3 fatty acid. This very common everyday life denomination gives the opportunity to introduce some nomenclature and fascinating facets of fatty acids. As stated before, in organic chemistry in general, each carbon is given a number, carbon number 1 starting with the functional group. As a result, the carbon of the carboxyl group is given the value “1” (blue numbers in Figure 4.42). In unsaturated fatty acid, the location of the double bond(s) is very important and is reflected in the naming. So the first approach to name fatty acid is to follow organic chemistry rules. For example, linoleic acid is a 18 carbon molecule and has two unsaturated bonds. The corresponding alkane is an octadecane, octadec- prefix meaning 18. But it also is a carboxylic acid, so the suffix will be -oic. It has two unsaturated bonds, so it is a diene, di- for 2, and -ene for alkene. The placement of the unsaturated bonds are on the 9th and 12th carbon. So its name is a 9,12-octadecdienoic acid or octadec-9,12-dienoic acid!! OK, but this does not really explain the omega part. In molecules of 16 to 22 carbons, it became obvious to chemists that it was just as easy to count from the other end or methyl end (fewer carbons to count!) to locate the double bonds. So they started to also report counting from the methyl end. Since “the alpha and the omega” is a known biblical expression meaning “the beginning and the end”, the “alpha” of the fatty acid became the beginning of the aliphatic chain (i.e., carbon number 2, see α linolenic acid in Figure 4.42), and the “omega” became the end carbon of the aliphatic chain. The expression “omega-3” really means “omega minus 3”, or that the last unsaturated bond is located at three carbons from the end. But what about the other double bond(s)? How does one know where it is (they are) located? Well, it turns out that for most polyunsaturated fatty acids, the double bonds are located every 3 carbons! Such that the carbons on each side of the double bonds are in the cis configuration, or that they ‘face’ each other rather than being on the oposite side of the double bond (in which case they would be in a trans configuration, further description in section 3.1.2). So lipid chemists have come up with much simplified nomenclature and the linoleic acid would then be referred to as a 18:2(n-3). This means that the fatty acid has 18 carbons, has 2 unsaturated bonds, the last one is the third carbon from the end (n-3, n replaces ω in most modern naming). And because there are no further precisions, all the double bonds are in a cis configuration and therefore the other double bond is at an (n-6) location. Voilà! The omega-3 fatty acids are a gateway to health sciences and medicine! Briefly, the two essential fatty acids cited above serve as precursor to other very important fatty acids. The first notable one is the arachidonic acid (20:4(n-6)). You should now be able to write its formula before you check it out! Arachidonic acid is the preponderant fatty acid included in the membrane phospholipids. It is also the presursor of very important C20 and C22 fatty acids, building blocks of membrane phospholipids of the brain. In fact, there is high probability that you might have heard about the EPA (eicosapentenoic acid 20:5(n-3), eicos- meaning 20, -penten- meaning five double bonds), and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid 22:6(n-3); docos- meaning 22, -hexaen- meaning six double bonds). With ALA, EPA and DHA are the most talked and researched after omega-3 lipids!! And indeed, there lots of evidence that these omega-3 are good for human health (e.g., Kris-Etherton, Hecker, and Binkoski 2004). Many conjugated (i.e., alternating single and double bonds; double bonds in trans configuration) polyunsaturated fatty acids have also recently been reported to have health benefits (e.g., Pariza, Park, and Cook 2000; Kris-Etherton, Hecker, and Binkoski 2004; Benjamin and Spener 2009) . Because arachidonic acid is so widely needed and available, it is also the precursor of an entire family of fatty acid derivatives referred to as the eicosanoid lipids (eicos- meaning 20, -oid meaning “like” or “derivatives”). These are oxidated fatty acids (then referred to as oxylipins) that serve as cellular messengers in mammalians. Their names might be familiar and include prostaglandins (vasodilators) or thromboxanes (vasoconstrictors). The last few paragraphs were designed to perk the interest of the chemist inside the reader and to show that there is great permeability among science fields. 4.3.4 Glycerolipids for energy storage Nearly all the commercially important fats and oils of animal and plant origin consist almost exclusively (&gt;95%) of the simple lipid class - triacylglycerols, which are chemically inert, highly hydrophobic and have a high energy density. This includes all the vegetable oils, such as those from corn (maize), olive, palm, and sunflower, and animal fats, such as tallow, lard and butter, as well as commercial products such as margarines (Christie, n.d.). Figure 4.43: Formation of triacylglycerols by esterification of three fatty acids to a glycerol backbone Triacylglycerols are the quintessential model for lipids (e.g., Figure 4.31). They are assemblages of long chain fatty acids esterified to a glycerol backbone (Figure 4.43). Fatty acids very loosely represent the equivalent of monomers in lipids, but the ester bonds do not represent true polymerization as the fatty acids are not directly bonded together, but are bonded to a backbone instead. Glycerolipids give the opportunity to reintroduce the term moiety. In a triacylglycerol, the glycerol moiety refers to as the part of the triacylglycerol that comes from the glycerol, illustrated in red in Figure 4.43. Lipids and nucleic acid monomers are assemblages of recognizable building blocks and each block in the final molecule is referred to as a moiety. The other moieties of triacylglycerol are the fatty acids. There is an entire classification of triacylglycerols depending on which glycerol atom is bonded to which fatty acid. But that is beyond what is needed here. The word triacylglycerol has been preferred over the older triglycerides. The equivalent of glycerolipids for the sugar backbone and sphingosine are covered in the sections below dedicated to saccharolipids and sphingolipids, respectively. 4.3.5 Glycerophospholipids or phospholipids for cell membranes 4.3.5.1 Phosphatidic acids as first type of third stage molecules The next stage of building blocks after the glycerolipids is the addition of a phosphate moiety to a diacylglycerol via a phosphoester bond with the remaining hydroxyl group of the glycerol moiety (Figure 4.44) to form phosphatidic acid. This molecule is an intermediate molecule for the synthesis of glycerophospholipids, built from the addition of, a least, another polar group building block. Figure 4.44: Formation of phosphatidic acid by esterification between a diacylglycerol and a phosphate Notice that because phosphoric acid has three hydroxyl group, it can theoretically make up to 3 ester bonds. In reality, this does not happen in organic molecules for several reasons. First, the tetrahedral shape of phosphate renders difficult the possibility of binding three aliphatic chains. Second, the electronic resonance makes the third hydroxyl much less attractive to forming bonds when the two others are already involved in bonds. So, for the vast majority of cases, phosphates can only form up to two phosphoester bonds. Phosphatidic acid has two hydroxyls available for additional binding, and one of them is used to bind with the fourth stage building blocks constituted by polar groups. The phosphatidic acid becomes a substituent to the polar group and the resulting molecules are then referred to as phosphatidyl polar group name. These are the famous phospholipids that make the majority of the memebrane bilayer of most plants, animals and bacteria. Another group called the glycolipids have a sugar instead of a phosphate moiety on the third stage. They are treated separately after the four stage phospholipid molecules below. 4.3.5.2 Polar groups for phospholipids 4.3.5.3 Glycosyldiacylglycerols as second type of third stage molecules The title is a bit of a mouthful, one has to admit… But the idea here is that instead of a phosphate, the diacylglycerol moiety is bonded to a sugar via a glycosidic bond. The sugar moeity, because it is linked via this bond is called a glycosyl group, hence the name. Sugars have multiple hydroxides hence possibilities to make bonds with other hydroxides, and in this case with the last hydroxide available on the glycerol backbone of diacylglycerols. The sugars acting as backbones are galactose or digalactose (two galactoses bonded by a glycosidic bond), but also a sulfoquinovose presented in the carbohydrate section and glucuronic acid (Christie, n.d.). The three glycolipids illustrated in Figure ?? are the membrane lipids essential to photosynthetic tissues in both higher plants and cyanobacteria. In fact these three account for more than 85% of the membrane lipids in thylakoids of plant plastids and cyanobacteria (Kobayashi 2016). These glycoglycerolipids are equivalent to and may substitute for phosphoglycerolipids, especially when the supply of phosphorus is restricted (Essigmann et al. 1998; Güler et al. 1996). Figure 4.45: Three main glycolipids that make the majority of the innerside of the membrane lipids of thylakoids in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria Of note, phosphate is not always the third moiety. Glucose has been found to be the third moiety in membrane lipids in some bacteria, although never in very significant proportions. Interestingly, in these cases, the glucose moiety itself is always accompanied with a phosphate moiety, such that in the end, these lipids are referred to as phosphoglycolipids (illustrated in Figure 4.34). Cell membranes in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells are forms in large part by the phospholipid bilayer. As stated earlier, it is the amphipathic nature o 4.3.6 Sphingosine: second common building block The important point though is that these acids, as their name suggests, have carboxyl groups at one end can bond through ester bonds to a suite of molecules referred to as backbones. 4.3.7 Glycerol based lipids Figure 4.46: Glycerolipids By LHcheM - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=20828285 4.3.8 Sterol based lipids 4.4 Proteins The second molecular family we choose to present is proteins. The word proteins used in English results from the French word protéine first coined by Dutch organic and analytical chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder in an article published in 1838 (Mulder 1838), and later translated in German as Protein in 1839. Both words are based on the ancient greek πρωτειοζ or proteios (~primary), because Mulder thought that the ‘organic acids making protéines appeared to be the primitive or principal substance that plants prepare for herbivores, which the latter provide to the carnivores’ (Mulder 1838; Hartley 1951). Proteins correspond to single, or assemblages of, polymers of amino acids referred to as polypeptide chains. This chapter is still under construction References "]
