\href{https://francoisbirgand.github.io}{François Birgand} is an
Associate Professor and
\href{https://provost.ncsu.edu/strategic-initiatives/university-faculty-scholars/}{University
Faculty Scholar} of biogeochemistry and ecological engineering in the
department of \href{https://www.bae.ncsu.edu/}{Biological and
Agricultural Engineering} at North Carolina State University, in
Raleigh, NC, USA. His research interests aim to provide solutions to
improve the quality of water in streams and rivers. Practically, his
research focuses on improving the treatment efficiency of streams,
wetlands, soils or wood chip bioreactors. Much of this research is based
upon principles this textbook is trying to provide for students of all
ages.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{intro}

A query using the word `biogeochemistry' on NC State University
libraries' website yielded 651 books on the subject in August
2018\ldots{} So why having yet another one, or even a course on the
subject\ldots{}?! I suppose we are never done with a subject which is
rather amorphous, as it involves many disciplines, and has many fields
of application.

Wikipedia \citeyearpar{Wikipedia_contributors2018-fs} has some nice
definitions of Biogeochemistry, including:

\begin{quote}
In particular, biogeochemistry is the study of the cycles of chemical
elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, and their interactions with and
incorporation into living things transported through earth scale
biological systems in space through time.
\end{quote}

With the definition above, the study of ancient earth history or of
modern acid rains \citep[e.g.,][]{0080446426} are included in
biogeochemistry\ldots{} The unifying theme is that regardless of the
application, the processes involved stay pretty much the same and
involve \emph{\textbf{transfer of electrons and protons}}. The
differences within biogeochemistry come from the fields of application.

The field of application of this book is \emph{\textbf{excess nutrient
and sediment loads generated by human activities, their consequences on
aquatic ecosystems, and the processes involved to improve and protect
watershed and stream water quality}}. There is a niche in disturbed,
nutrient rich, often rural environments, where we perceived there was a
need for an integrated and horizontal delivery of knowledge spanning
from electron orbitals, biochemistry, microbiology, hydrological
functioning, process kinetic modeling, and treatment system design. It
is possible that readers with strong biological background might find
the biological facet of this book a bit short and simple. Just as well,
non-engineers should not be afraid of `engineering' in the title. The
course is designed to provide the biological knowledge engineers might
not have obtained in their curriculae, and the quantitative knowledge
non-engineers might not have been exposed to. Regardless, I do hope that
environemental scientists, ecologists, and engineers alike, will find
the integration of knowlege useful in this book.

The physical objects used as foundation for this class include naturally
occurring and human-designed filters, which may reduce excess nutrient
concentrations and loads in rural and suburban environments. Systems
reviewed include wetlands, riparian buffers and vegetated filter strips,
woodchip bioreactors, streams, stormwater ponds and bioretention zones.
This book uses excess nitrogen as the core parameter where the
principles of biogeochemical processes are well illustrated, and may
apply to other fields of application.

\chapter{Glossary}\label{glossary}

This glossary is meant to assemble terms that we routinely use in
Environmental Sciences and Engineering and which are expected to be
mastered by students taking BAE 204 at NC State university. They are
ordered in alphabetical list for better retrieval and look up.

\section{A}\label{a}

\subsection{Aerobic respiration}\label{aerobic-respiration}

\subsection{Anaerobic respiration}\label{anaerobic-respiration}

\subsection{Ammonia}\label{ammonia}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia}{Ammonia} is a colorless
  gas with a characteristic pungent smell
\item
  Formula: \(NH_3\)
\item
  Ammonia 3D shape:
  \includegraphics[width=0.25000\textwidth]{pictures/Ammonia-3D-balls-A.png}
\item
  Lewis dot structure:
  \includegraphics[width=0.25000\textwidth]{pictures/ammonia-lewis-structure.jpg}
\item
  Number of electron N has for itself following electronegativity rule:
  eight
\item
  \(NH_3\) can only be an \textbf{electron donor}
\item
  Because N has so many electrons to be potentially donated, ammonia is
  generally unstable in an aerobic environment. As a result, it tends to
  trace quantities in nature
\item
  When dissolved in water, and depending on the pH of the solution,
  ammonia converts to \protect\hyperlink{NH4}{ammonium} following the
  reaction:
\end{itemize}

\[
H_2O + NH_3 \rightleftharpoons OH^{-} + NH_4^{+}
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Production:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced
    inorganic chemicals. Dozens of chemical plants worldwide produce
    ammonia. Consuming more than 1\% of all man-made power, ammonia
    production is a significant component of the world energy budget.
  \item
    In 2014, about 88\% of the ammonia produced was used for fertilizing
    agricultural crops
  \item
    Modern ammonia-producing plants generally depend on the
    \protect\hyperlink{haber-bosch}{Haber-Bosch process} which consists
    into reducing dinitrogen into ammonia

    \[
    3\,H_2 + N_2 \to 2\,NH_3
    \]
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Consumption:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most
    nitrogen-containing compounds. Virtually all synthetic nitrogen
    compounds are derived from ammonia.
  \item
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{\protect\hyperlink{top}{back to top}}

\subsection{Ammonium}\label{ammonium}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium}{Ammonium} is the most
  reduced inorganic nitrogenous cation (positively charged).
\item
  Ammonium 3D shape:
  \includegraphics[width=0.25000\textwidth]{pictures/Ammonium-3D-balls.png}
\item
  Lewis dot structure:
  \includegraphics[width=0.25000\textwidth]{pictures/ammonium_lewis_structure.png}
\item
  Number of electron N has for itself following electronegativity rule:
  eight
\item
  It is formed by the protonation of \protect\hyperlink{NH3}{ammonia}
  following the reaction:
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
H_2O + NH_3 \rightleftharpoons OH^{-} + NH_4^{+} \label{eq:NH3}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The relative abundance of ammonium vs ammonia depends on the pH of the
  solution. See figure below
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{Textbook_BAE204_files/figure-latex/NH3-NH4-1.pdf}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Because in most natural aqueous environments, pH is below 8, ammonium
  tends to be the preponderant form.
\item
  Production:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In nature, ammonium is a waste product of the mineralization of
    organic molecules
  \item
    It is added as fertilizer on soils as
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate}{ammonium
    nitrate}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Health hazard:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ammonia vapor has a sharp, irritating, pungent odor that acts as a
    warning of potentially dangerous exposure
  \item
    Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result
    in lung damage and death
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Drinking water standard:
\end{itemize}

\emph{\protect\hyperlink{top}{back to top}}

\subsection{Ammonium nitrate}\label{ammonium-nitrate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate}{Ammonium
  nitrate} is a chemical compound, the nitrate salt of the ammonium
  cation
\item
  It is a white crystal solid and is highly soluble in water.
\item
  Formula: \(NH_4NO_3\)
\item
  3D shape:
  \includegraphics[width=0.33000\textwidth]{pictures/Ammonium-nitrate-xtal-3D-balls-A.png}
\item
  It is predominantly used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer
\item
  Its other major use is as a component of explosive mixtures used in
  mining, quarrying, and civil construction
\item
  Production:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ammonium nitrate does exist naturally in mines of the
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert}{Atacama desert}
    in Chile but globally nearly all ammonium nitrate is now produced
    synthetically
  \item
    Byproduct of all respiration processes. Ammonium ions are a waste
    product of the metabolism of animals. In fish and aquatic
    invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals,
    sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the urea cycle to urea,
    because urea is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In
    birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is
    converted into uric acid, which is solid and can therefore be
    excreted with minimal water loss.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Consumption/utilization:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It is used as a fertilizer, because it tends to release inorganic
    nitrogen slowly in soil. Applied as a surface fertilizer, it
    penetrates the soil with rainfall infiltration. Highly soluble, the
    nitrate anion becomes readily available to plant roots, although it
    is susceptible to leaching below the root system into the shallow
    and deep groundwater. The ammonium cation tends to adsorb to soil
    particles and is thus not as susceptible to leaching. Ammonium can
    be directly uptaken by plant roots, which thermodynamically makes
    sense, although because in most soils aerobic conditions are
    preponderant, nitrate tends to be the ion uptaken most often. Soil
    bacteria in the aerobic zone of the soil will oxidize adsorbed
    ammonium into nitrate, which then becomes available for plant roots.
    The whole chain of events slows the release of inorganic nitrogen to
    crops and thus makes for more effective fertilizers.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Health hazard

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No direct known health hazard
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{\protect\hyperlink{top}{back to top}}

\subsection{Anoxic waters}\label{anoxic-waters}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Anoxic waters are areas of sea water, fresh water, or groundwater that
  are depleted of dissolved oxygen and are a more severe condition of
  hypoxia (Wikipedia)
\item
  Anoxic waters result from an \emph{\textbf{IMBALANCE}} between oxygen
  supply and demand
\end{itemize}

\emph{\protect\hyperlink{top}{back to top}}

\section{C}\label{c}

\subsection{Carbon dioxide}\label{carbon-dioxide}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Carbon dioxide is a colorless gas which density is 50\% higher than
  that of dry air.
\item
  Formula: CO\textsubscript{2}
\item
  Carbon dioxide 3D shape:
  \includegraphics[width=0.25000\textwidth]{pictures/Carbon_dioxide_3D_ball.png}
\item
  Lewis dot structure:
  \includegraphics{pictures/CO2_lewis_structure.png}
\item
  Number of electron C has for itself following electronegativity rule:
  zero
\item
  CO\textsubscript{2} can only be an electron acceptor
\item
  Production:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    oxidation of C in all organic molecules
  \item
    Almost all respiratory processes on earth (some respiration does not
    involve oxidation of C)
  \item
    Combustion of all Carbon-based fuel
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Consumption:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Photosynthesis

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Atmospheric carbon dioxide \textbf{is the primary carbon source
      for life} on Earth
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Calcite precipitation in the oceans
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Ecological Significance:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Greenhouse Gas, which serves as reference for all other GHG
  \item
    Concentration in the atmosphere \textasciitilde{}380 ppm on the
    rise, or 0.38\%, or a partial pressure of 0.38 atm
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{\protect\hyperlink{top}{back to top}}

\subsection{Carbonates}\label{carbonates}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  After carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it will combine with water to
  form carbonic acid (\(H_2CO_3\)).
\item
  Carbonate serves as \textbf{the carbon source} for aquatic vegetation
\item
  Carbonic acid can then dissociate into bicarbonate (\(HCO_3^-\)) and
  carbonate (\(CO_3^{2-}\))
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
The term ``bicarbonate'' was coined in 1814 by the English chemist
William Hyde Wollaston. The prefix ``bi'' in ``bicarbonate'' comes from
an outdated naming system and is based on the observation that there is
twice as much carbonate (CO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{2−}) per
sodium ion in sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO\textsubscript{3}) and other
bicarbonates than in sodium carbonate
(Na\textsubscript{2}CO\textsubscript{3}) and other carbonates. The name
lives on as a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_name}{trivial
name}. \citep{Wikipedia_contributors2018-lc}.
\end{quote}

\begin{align}
H_2CO_3  & \rightleftharpoons & HCO_3^- + H^+  \label{eq:H2CO3} \\
HCO_3^- & \rightleftharpoons & CO_3^{2-} + H^+ \label{eq:HCO3}
\end{align}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In an environment not open to the atmosphere (or where direct exchange
  with the atmosphere is very limited like in stream or wetland
  sediment), the preponderant form depends on the pH and can be
  calculated as illustrated on the graph below.
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{Textbook_BAE204_files/figure-latex/CO3-1.pdf}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Carbon dioxide and carbonates are fully oxidized forms of inorganic
  molecules with just one atom of C: the carbon atom has \textbf{zero
  electrons} for itself as shown in Figure
  \ref{fig:ElecAlloc-CO2-carbonates}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.22\linewidth]{pictures/ElecAlloc_CO2} \includegraphics[width=0.22\linewidth]{pictures/ElecAlloc_H2CO3} \includegraphics[width=0.22\linewidth]{pictures/ElecAlloc_HCO3-} \includegraphics[width=0.22\linewidth]{pictures/ElecAlloc_CO32-} 

}

\caption{Electron allocation on each of the fully oxidized forms of C, including from left to right CO~2~, carbonic acid, hydrogen carbonate (or bicarbonate), and carbonate, showing that the C atoms have no electrons for themselves}\label{fig:ElecAlloc-CO2-carbonates}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In sea water, Carbonate can combine with Ca\textsuperscript{2+} to
  form Calcium Carbonate (CaCO\textsubscript{3}), which precipitates out
  of solution. In other words, calcium carbonate formation is a sink for
  carbonate, and ultimately from CO\textsubscript{2} addition from the
  atmosphere to to increased CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations in the
  atmosphere.
\item
  Carbonates are thus a great pH buffer in aquatic environments
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{catabolism}{\subsection{Catabolism}\label{catabolism}}

\tightlist
\item
  Reactions involving the breaking down of organic substrates, typically

  TP) and/or to generate metabolic intermediates used in subsequent
  anabolic reactions \citep{De_Bolster1997-ul}.
\item
  Synonyms:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Aerobic and anaerobic \emph{respirations} which use organic
    molecules as electron donors, are synonyms of catabolism.
  \item
    In soil science another synonym of catabolism is
    \emph{mineralization}, which refers to the decomposition or

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Greenhouse gases
\emph{(GHG)}}{Greenhouse gases (GHG)}}\label{greenhouse-gases-ghg}

A greenhouse gas is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits
radiant energy within the thermal infrared range. This process is the
fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases
in Earth's atmosphere are \textbf{water vapor},
\textbf{\protect\hyperlink{CO2}{carbon dioxide}}, \textbf{methane},
\textbf{\protect\hyperlink{N2O}{nitrous oxide}}, and \textbf{ozone}.
Without greenhouse gases, the average temperature of Earth's surface
would be about −18 °C (0 °F), rather than the present average of 15 °C
(59 °F). In the Solar System, the atmospheres of Venus, Mars and Titan
also contain gases that cause a greenhouse effect.

  \(NO_3^{-}\) is technically the conjugate base of nitric acid
  \(HNO_3\), but the \(pk_A\) of the reaction is at a theoretical pH of
  -1.38. In other words, for the pH of most natural waters (4.5
  \textless{} pH \textless{} 8), \(HNO_3\) is totally insignificant.

    \textbf{Uptake} from microbes, plants, and algae for their

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Uptake, assimilation, anabolism, immobilization are all synonymous
      terms to express the fact that the N atom is immobilized, at least
      temporarily in organic molecules.
    \item
      Because N is assimilated in organic molecules during
      uptake/anabolism, and because N gains electrons in the process (it
      is thus \textbf{\emph{reduced}}), we refer to nitrate uptake as
      \textbf{\protect\hyperlink{ANR}{assimilatory nitrate reduction}}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{\protect\hyperlink{denitrification}{Denitrification}}: under
    anaerobic conditions, nitrate is used by facultative anaerobes as
    electron acceptor to generate \protect\hyperlink{ATP}{ATP} in their
    respiration chain. The two major end products of denitrification are
    gases, namely \protect\hyperlink{N2}{dinitrogen (\(N_2\))} and
    \protect\hyperlink{N2O}{nitrous oxide (\(N_2O\))}, which leave the
    aqueous environment. As such, nitrate is not assimilated by any
    bacteria and denitrification is therefore, as opposed to uptake,
    referred to as **\protect\hyperlink{DNR}{dissimilatory nitrate
    reduction} into \protect\hyperlink{N2}{dinitrogen (\(N_2\))} and
    \protect\hyperlink{N2O}{nitrous oxide (\(N_2O\))}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Ecological significance:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Because of assimilation and denitrification processes, the overall
    nitrate concentrations in rivers tends to diminish from the
    catchment headwaters to the receiving bodies such as estuaries and
    coastal areas. As a result, inorganic nitrogen has naturally been in
    very short supply in these coastal water bodies, and nitrate and
    traditionally been the nutrient limiting aquatic productivity there.
    Very much like with phosphate, algae have adapted to be able to grow
    in very low concentrations. Anthropogenic activities, and
    agriculture in particular, have largely increased the loads and
    concentration of nitrate reaching estuaries, to the point where
    nitrate is no longer the limiting factor. As a result, excess
    nitrate is one of the reasons for the global and persistent presence
    of algal blooms in estuaries and coastal waters.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Health hazard:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    There is a heated debate about the health hazard that nitrate might
    pose. Some argue that if anything, there might be beneficial
    effects, while others argue that there are evidence of cancers
    linked to excess nitrate absorption. Unfortunately, arguments on
    both sides might not be totally independent of militantism and
    lobbies.
  \item
    The only consensus everybody seems to agree upon is the Blue Baby
    syndrome, or methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobinemia is an unusual and
    potentially fatal condition in which hemoglobin is oxidized to
    methemoglobin and loses its ability to bind and transport oxygen,
    hence the cyanosis (blue appearance) usually visible on fingers,
    toes, and lips. Nitrate reduced to nitrite in the body of humans and
    animals enters the body stream where it seems to directly oxidize
    oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin-peroxide complex.

    has provided maximum concentration guidelines of 50 mg/L as nitrate
    \citep{World_Health_Organization2011-hd}. These guidelines have been
    enacted in hard laws in the US and in Europe. The 50 mg/L as nitrate
    equates 11.2 mg \(NO_3\)-N/L and in the US, the drinking water

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Oxidation is the \emph{\textbf{loss of electrons}} by a molecule,
  atom, or ion.
\item
  The term oxidation was first used by Antoine Lavoisier to signify
  reaction of a substance with oxygen. Much later, it was realized that
  the substance, upon being oxidized, loses electrons, and the meaning
  was extended to include other reactions in which electrons are lost.

\hypertarget{oxidation-state}{\subsection{Oxidation
state}\label{oxidation-state}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The oxidation state (\emph{OS}), or sometimes referred to as the
  oxidation number, quantifies the number of electrons that an atom has
  gained (expressed as \emph{\textbf{negative}} charge value) or lost
  (expressed as \emph{\textbf{positive}} charge value) compared to the
  number of valence electrons it has in its free form. As a result, it
  can be zero, positive or negative.
\item
  For metal ions, the OS corresponds to its charge
\item
  The \emph{change} in oxidation state is a very powerful tool to
  understand the \protect\hyperlink{redox}{redox} processes involved in
  the environement. But OS is less than ideal when comparing the
  absolute number of electrons one element \emph{has for itself}
\item
  For example, the nitrogen atom N, has 5 valence electrons. In the
  dinitrogen molecule N\textsubscript{2}, the Lewis dot structure
  suggests that each atom share 3 electrons with the other but
  essentially have 5 electrons for themselves as in Figure
  \ref{fig:ElecAlloc-N2}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{pictures/ElecAlloc_N2} 

}

\caption{Electron allocation on each of the N atom for the dinitrogen molecule N~2~}\label{fig:ElecAlloc-N2}
\end{figure}

As a result, the number of electron on each atom equals the number of
valence electrons on the free form of N, hence OS = 0. Now in the
nitrous oxide case in Figure \ref{fig:ElecAlloc-N2O}, the nitrogen atom
to the left OS = 0, but for the middle Nitrogen atom, OS = -2, as two
electrons were stripped by oxygen.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{pictures/ElecAlloc_N2O} 

}

\caption{Electron allocation on each of the N atom for the N~2~O molecule}\label{fig:ElecAlloc-N2O}
\end{figure}

The problem with the oxidation state indicator is that it is a relative
number, and not absolute. The electron allocation indicator that
quantifies the number of electrons each atom has for itself is more
abolute and thus comparable. For example, the inorganic molecule with
one C atom stable in an oxidized environment is CO\textsubscript{2}, the
inorganic molecule with one N atom stable in an oxidized environment is
\(NO_3^-\), and the inorganic molecule with one S atom stable in an
oxidized environment is \(SO_4^{2-}\). All three atoms have zero
electrons for themselves as oxygen has `stolen' them (Figure
\ref{fig:ElecAlloc-CO2-NO3-SO4}). So they are all potential electron
acceptors that can accept up to 8 electrons. In a way they are very
similar.

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{pictures/ElecAlloc_CO2} \includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{pictures/ElecAlloc_NO3-} \includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{pictures/ElecAlloc_SO42-} 

}

\caption{Electron allocation on each of the C, N, and S atom for the CO~2~, nitrate and sulfate molecules}\label{fig:ElecAlloc-CO2-NO3-SO4}
\end{figure}

But if one calculates the oxidation states for each of the C, N, and S
atoms, for these three molecules, one would find OS\textsubscript{C} =
-4, OS\textsubscript{N} = -5, and OS\textsubscript{S} = -6\ldots{} We
believe this can be very confusing and prefer to use the electron
allocation concept as a more absolute indicator.

  \begin{itemize}

    the first convention is that the oxidizer is on the left of the

    then one adds the appropriate number of H\textsuperscript{+} to
    balance the H
  \item
    Finally one adds the appropriate number of e\textsuperscript{-} to
    balance the charge. The number of e\textsuperscript{-} must
    correspond to the change in

\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a redox reaction \textbf{always} involves two half reactions where the
  electrons are transfered from the lowest redox potential couple to the
  highest redox potential couple. For example, the combustion of methane
  in oxygen involves the two O\textsubscript{2}/H\textsubscript{2}O and
  CO\textsubscript{2}/CH\textsubscript{4} couples. The half-reaction of
  the highest redox potential couple goes on top, and that of the lowest
  potential at the bottom, but this time written as red/ox like in the
  equation below:
\end{itemize}

\begin{align}
2\,O_2 + 8\,H^+ + 8\,e^- & \rightleftharpoons & 4\,H_2O\\
CH_4 + 2\,H_2O & \rightleftharpoons & CO_2 + 8\,H^+ + 8\,e^-\\
& &\\
\hline\\
CH_4 + 2\,O_2 & \to & CO_2 + 2\,H_2O
\end{align}

The electrons cancel out, and in this case the protons as well. So the
combustion of methane, which is very simple at first glance, really
involves a transfer of electrons, which the half-reactions reveal.

\subsection{Skeletal formula}\label{skeletal-formula}

\begin{quote}
The skeletal formula, also called line-angle formula or shorthand
formula, of an organic compound is a type of molecular structural
formula that serves as a shorthand representation of a molecule's
bonding and some details of its molecular geometry
\citep{Wikipedia_contributors2018-sa}.

\item
  Number of electron S has for itself following electronegativity rule:
  zero
\item
  \(SO_4^{2-}\) can only be an \emph{\textbf{electron acceptor}}
\item
  \(SO_4^{2-}\) is the conjugate base of Hydrogen sulfate \(HSO_4^{-}\).
  The figure below shows that for pH normally measured in surface water
  and streams (4.5-8), \(SO_4^{2-}\) is the truly preponderant form. We
  therefore generally omit to mention \(HSO_4^{-}\) as a chemical form
  that plays any significant role.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  During their anabolism, primary producers uptake sulfate, but the
  sulfur atoms can be incorporated into amino-acids only after sulfur
  has been reduced, or gained 8 electrons to be in a thiol (\(-SH\))
  form.
