Chapter summary:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Living organisms have a seemingly infinite complexity and diversity of molecules
</li>
<li>
Yet, most organisms are made of 6 major atoms CHONSP assembled into four major molecular families: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.
</li>
<li>
Complex molecules are polymers of simple monomers
</li>
<li>
Each molecular family has specific structure to achieve specific function. Details of each are summarized in this chapter
</li>
<li>
In organic molecules, about 4 electrons are stored on each carbon atom, none on the phosphorus, and always 8 electrons on the nitrogen and sulfur atoms
</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Polymers of simple monomers</h2>
<p>When scientists of the 18<sup>th</sup> century observed nature, they thought there had to be major differences between <em>animated</em> organisms and the <em>inanimate</em> ones. In fact they thought that the elements at the basis of the animated vs. inanimate things had to be different. One can only wonder at the incredible diversity and complexity of forms between a bacterium and humans, and between unicellular algae and sequoia trees! And yet, despite the incredible variations of life forms and sizes, there is a common theme: very complex organic molecules are <strong>polymers of relatively simple monomers</strong>.</p>
<p>In the image of a brick wall and the skyscraper in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:brickwall">4.1</a>, it is possible to make a small wall or a huge skyscraper. Brick walls are made of bricks <strong>and</strong> of mortar to hold the bricks together. If one adds metal pieces, wood, etc. the complexity of the final product can be infinite, yet it is made from simple elementary pieces.</p>

<p>Living organisms are essentially made of very complex polymers, but which are all built from simple monomers. Just like in a building which complexity results from the assemblage of different types of material, e.g., bricks, wood, metal, etc., living organisms are assembled from distinct ‘types of molecules’. Among the very complex organic polymers, one can distinguish four <strong>molecular families</strong> (in addition to what we refer to as co-enzymes), where in each family, there is a repeated pattern. A molecular family can be defined as</p>
<ul>
<li>polymers of <em>similar</em> monomers <em>within</em> a family but <em>distinct between</em> families</li>
<li>a mortar or chemical bonds which binds monomers together</li>
</ul>
<p>The four molecular families that make organic molecules include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbohydrates</li>
<li>Proteins</li>
<li>Nucleic acids</li>
<li>Lipids</li>
</ul>

<p>Carbohydrates form the entry molecules onto which electrons are first stored in <a href="photosynthesis.html#photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, and precisely on the carbon atoms. The generic formula for carbohydrates is (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>, and each atom, on average, has 4 electrons for itself as illustrated in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:elecalloc-CH2O">4.2</a>. We have seen in the previous chapter that having 4 electrons stored on each C is probably the most cost effective way to store many electrons on organic molecules.</p>

<p>Carbohydrates are a rather homogeneous group as they include clearly identified monomers and polymers of these monomers. Most monomers (monolignols being a notable exception) are C6 or C5 rings and can, depending on their nature and on their polymerization type, serve very different purposes including energy storage (e.g., starch), structure (e.g., cellulose or chitin of cructacean shells), or as backbone of RNA (e.g., ribose). On an everyday life basis, carbohydrates are present in paper, sugar, pasta, grain, etc (some common carbohydrates in food illustrated in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:carbohydrates-in-food">4.3</a>).</p>

<div id="monosaccharides" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Monosaccharides</h3>
<p>The monomers of carbohydrates are called <strong>monosaccharides</strong> (from Greek <em>monos</em>, i.e., single, and <em>sacchar</em>, sugar) or called <em>simple sugars</em> or <strong>oses</strong> (from the Latin “full of, abounding in, having qualities of”). The monomers that are assembled into complex polymers generally are hexoses, that is that they have 6 carbons, and are isomers of glucose. However, monosaccharides do include more than just hexoses or C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, and it is important to present them in general, and not just the monomers of <em>poly</em>saccharides.</p>
<p>Most monosaccharides are made of 3 to 6 carbons (there actually are C7 to C9 oses) and are classified in <em>aldoses</em> or <em>ketoses</em>, depending on whether they have a <em>aldehyde</em> (-CHO) on their C#1 or a <em>ketone</em> (C=O) radical, usually on the carbon numbered #2 (details on these functional groups in sections <a href="functional-groups.html#aldehyde">3.2.7</a> and <a href="functional-groups.html#ketone">3.2.8</a>). They either exist in linear chains and are then represented in <a href="glossary.html#structural-formula">Fischer projection</a> like in Figures <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:aldoses">4.4</a> and <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:ketoses">4.5</a>, or, for pentoses (C5) and hexoses (C6), exist in cyclic chains (Figures <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:riboses">4.7</a> and <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:glucose-fructose">4.6</a>). Carbohydrates have been given a lot of codes and naming conventions and it is hard to avoid them if we want to put things together. So, do not be scared by all the names and letters used to describe and differentiate carbohydrates. The goal is:</p>
<ul>
<li>to realize the large diversity of monosaccharides</li>
<li>to realize that the differences between, e.g., the hexoses are of steric consideration, i.e., which side are the hydroxyl (-OH) groups of the linear chain, right or left.</li>
<li>to realize that C5 and C6 carbohydrates alternate between chain and cyclic molecular configurations. The cyclic form prevails for the functions of transport and structure that the carbohydrates provide. The chain form is the form needed for the release of electrons and energy. Both forms interchange freely for monosaccharides.</li>

<p>Time to incorporate some jargon. When in the chain form necessary for the carbons to donate their electrons, monosaccharides are called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_sugar">reducing sugars</a></strong>. This means that they are able to donate their electrons, to drive respiration and the generation of energy in the cell (details in Chapter <a href="aerobic-and-anaerobic-respiration.html#aerobic-and-anaerobic-respiration">5</a>). So, despite the fact that each carbon atom on monosaccharides has 4 electrons to give, potentially, this does not systematically happen. Strange, is it not? Indeed, for the pentoses and hexoses to be <em>reducing sugars</em>, they must be in the aldose form, or have a free aldehyde at the end of their chain or on carbon #1. So this rules out the ketoses? Actually no, the ketoses in the chain form can be readily <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautomer">tautomerized</a></em> into aldoses. This is only important to explain some of the differences in disaccharides.</p>

<p>You might wonder what the D-(+) or D-(-) might mean in the legends of Figures <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:aldoses">4.4</a> and <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:ketoses">4.5</a>… This is due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_rotation">optical rotation properties</a> that a pure solution of a particular ose has because of the asymmetry of the molecules. The different forms of hexoses in, e.g., Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:aldoses">4.4</a> are called <a href="#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiomer">eniantiomers</a>. D means that the hydroxyl group on the C#<sub>n-1</sub> to the right of the molecule and most natural oses tend to be D (few oses have it on the left, in which case they are coded as L). The (+) or (-) tell whether the light rotation is pulled towards positive or negative angles. OK, lots of terms here, mostly to quench some of the curiosity of the biochemist in you.</p>
<p>Now that we have a more holistic view of what monosaccharides are made of, for all our purposes, we will reduce all this great variability to a few of them, which are glyceraldehyde (C3), ribose and deoxyribose (C5), and, glucose and fructose (C6). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyceraldehyde">Glyceraldehyde</a> is an important intermediate molecule of photosynthesis. We have seen the glycerol molecule in section <a href="functional-groups.html#commonmolecules">3.4</a>, which is a propan-tri-ol, or three hydroxyl group on each of the 3 carbons. For glyceraldehyde, an end alcohol group is oxidized to an aldehyde group.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, pentoses and hexoses have the tendency to form cyclic or ring molecules ‘through a nucleophilic addition reaction between the carbonyl group and one of the hydroxyls of the same molecule. The reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging oxygen atom’ <span class="citation">(Wikipedia contributors <a href="#ref-Wikipedia_contributors2018-li">2018</a><a href="#ref-Wikipedia_contributors2018-li">e</a>)</span>. The most common rings are made of 5 or 6 atoms, respectively with four C atoms <strong>and</strong> one O atom, and, five C atoms <strong>and</strong> one O atom (cyclic forms also referred to as <em>furanose</em> and <em>pyranose</em>, respectively, because they closely resemble <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furan">furan</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyran">pyran</a> rings). In Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:glucose-fructose">4.6</a>, both glucose and fructose are hexoses. But fructose generally forms furanose rings (5 atoms, including one oxygen atom), while glucose forms pyranose rings. The α and β correspond to whether the hydroxyl on the C#1 atom is below (α) or above (β) the plan made by the ring. Some more jargon here added for exactness of information only.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:riboses"></span>

<p>Ribose and deoxyribose are the most important pentoses we need to know as they constitute one of the three ensembles that constitute <a href="#Nucleic-acids">nucleotides</a>, i.e., the monomers of nucleic acids. They both exist either in furanose or pyranose forms, although the furanose form dominates, but the difference between ribose and deoxyribose is the missing oxygen atom on the C2’ atom (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:riboses">4.7</a>). And yes, you guessed it right, this difference is the reason for the ‘R’ and ‘D’ in the RNA and DNA molecules. Notice that the carbon atoms are numbered in Figures <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:glucose-fructose">4.6</a> and <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:riboses">4.7</a>. The numbers are ‘primed’ for the ribose and deoxyribose (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:riboses">4.7</a>). This is a convention that geneticians have used to differentiate the carbons from the pentose to those of the base in nucleotides (see part on <a href="molecular-families.html#nucleic-acids">nucleic acids</a>). This is anecdotal information again.</p>
<p>Now, as the pentoses and hexoses form rings, an interesting group appears and is referred to as the <strong>acetal</strong> group (see additional details in section <a href="functional-groups.html#hemiacetal">3.3.5</a>. Yet another term needed to understand some of the subtleties of the functions of the di- and polysaccharides… For the aldohexoses to form rings, the aldehyde on carbon #1 (Figures <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:aldoses">4.4</a>) reacts with the hydroxyl of carbon #5 to form a 6 atom ring (e.g. for glucose on Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:glucose-fructose">4.6</a>). And in can easily revert to the chain structure to have a free aldehyde again and be a reducing sugar. For fructose, a ketohexose, the ketone from carbon #2, reacts with the hydroxyl of also carbon #5, to now form a 5 atom ring (Fructose on Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:glucose-fructose">4.6</a>). So why is this important enough to be mentioned here…?</p>
<p>In the ring versions of the glucose and fructose, the carbons #1 and #2 now have single bonds with two oxygen atoms. This group formed by a central carbon, and bonds in a tetrahedral as illustrated in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:acetal">4.8</a> is a rather special bond. In fact, special enough that it has some interesting consequences, with two different forms. If one of the atoms bound to oxygen is different than hydrogen (e.g., R’ and R&quot; in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:acetal">4.8</a> both <em>not</em> H), then this group is called an <strong>acetal</strong> group, and the bond is a rather stable bond. If one of the R’ or R&quot; in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:acetal">4.8</a> <em>is</em> H, while the other has some other radical, then the structure becomes asymetric, the group formed is then called <strong>hemiacetal</strong> as is not nearly as stable, which explains why the hexoses so easily switch from the linear chain to the cyclic configurations. This hemiacetal group is one of the basis of the glycosidic bond, which binds the cyclic pentoses and hexoses in di- and polysaccharides, but also with other molecules.</p>

<p>So, what is there to remember about monosaccharides?</p>
<ul>
<li>Their formula is (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub> where 3 &lt; n &lt; 6 generally</li>
<li>The C3 atom monosaccharide to remember is glyceraldehyde</li>
<li>Small differences in the position of hydroxyl, and in the cyclisation of the C5 and C6 make for different monosaccharides</li>
<li>Each atom has <em>on average</em> 4 electrons for itself, making monosaccharides the ideal molecule to store and release energy electrons, although they have to be in the aldose chain form</li>
<li>Thanks to all the hydroxyl groups, monosaccharides are extremely soluble in water.</li>
<li>Glucose is arguably the most important monosaccharide and the only hexose molecule you are expected to know how to draw by heart</li>
</ul>
<p>For glucose, and for organic chemistry in general, there are several ways of representing molecules. One of the ways is the <a href="#haworth">Haworth projection</a> as shown in Figures <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:glucose-fructose">4.6</a> and <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:riboses">4.7</a>. Another way is called the <a href="#Fischer">Fischer projection</a> as illustrated in Figures <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:aldoses">4.4</a> and <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:ketoses">4.5</a>. Another way is called the <a href="glossary.html#skeletal-formula">skeletal formula</a> where the carbons are implied at the corners and the ends of line segments, while oxygen and other remarkable radicals such as hydroxyl or amine are noted. Glucose is thus often represented as skeletal formula as in the left of Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:glucose-skeletal">4.9</a>. Another even more simplified representation of glucose is represented in the ‘hyper’ skeletal formula. The latter has the advantage to be simple enough to be used to illustrate polysaccharides.</p>

<div id="dissacharides" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Dissacharides</h3>
<p>Sucrose, lactose, and maltose are three common dissaccharides. Dissacharides are bioses or polymers of two hexose monomers. Because they are still small, and thanks to their solubility in water (thanks to hydroxyl groups), they play an essential role to transport energy in chemical forms because for a slight increase of the osmotic pressure in a liquid, dissaccharides carry twice the number of electrons.</p>
<p>Dissaccharides correspond to the assemblage of two monosaccharides thanks to the <a href="#glycosidic-bond">glycosidic bond</a>. The name of this bond suggests that it is very specific to carbohydrates, and it is true as one monosaccharide must be involved in a glysidic bond. So the glycosidic bond is a type of covalent bond that joins a carbohydrate (sugar) molecule to another group, which may or may not be another carbohydrate. The common theme, however, is that the <strong>carbon of the sugar involved corresponds to that of the hemiacetal group</strong>. There are 4 types of glycosidic bonds, depending on the atom directly linked to the <em>hemiacetal</em> carbon of the carbohydrate: O-, N-, S-, or C-glycosidic bonds. Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:O-N-glycosidic-bond">4.10</a> illustrates the generic O- and N-glycosidic bond.</p>

<p>The N-glycosidic bond occurs in nucleotides and thus plays a major role. But overall, the term glycosidic bond generally refers to the O-glycosidic bond between two consecutive monosaccharides (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:O-maltose-glycosidic-bond">4.11</a>). In the end, and to go back to the brick and mortar analogy, for di- and polysaccharides, the <strong>glycosidic bond is the equivalent of the mortar</strong>.</p>

</div>
<p>Lactose and maltose (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:lactose-maltose">4.12</a>) are dissaccharides, respectively assembled from a galactose and a glucose, and, from two glucose molecules. Notice that these two molecules are reducing sugars, i.e., there is one hemicetal carbon (C#1) free to potentially open one glucose into a chain form, hence the ability for both lactose and maltose to be readily available as electron donors. This is quite nice for lactose produced by mammal females to be readily available for their offsprings. On another note, during seed germination, starch (details below) is hydrolyzed into maltose first by the amylase enzyme, and then readily participate in energy generation for this critical time of seed plant lives.</p>

<p>Interestingly, sucrose in <em>not</em> a reducing sugar as both hemiacetal carbons (C#1 of glucose, and C#2 of fructose) are part of the glycosidic bond (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:sucrose">4.13</a>). There are several advantages:</p>

<img src="pictures/sucrose.png" alt="Sucrose molecular formula" width="48%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4.13: Sucrose molecular formula
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Sucrose is a very stable molecule, and a lot more than lactose and maltose. Hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond is very slow and solutions of sucrose can last for a very long time.</li>
<li>Because both hemiacetal carbons are bound, there are no more possibilities for an additional glycosidic bond to take place: sucrose stays as a dissaccharide</li>
</ul>
<p>This is actually essential for green vascular plants, which assemble sucrose in their leaves from glucose and fructose, but must transport these molecules away from the leaves to minimize weight and avoid jamming of the photosynthesis. So having a very stable, highly soluble, not polymerisable, non reducing molecule is very advantageous. Sucrose can then be hydrolyzed thanks to the sucrase enzyme into glucose and fructose again for use or storage at other places in the plants.</p>
<p>So what is there to remember?</p>
<ul>
<li>The glycosidic bond always involves one hemiacetal group and is the key to for carbohydrate <em>di-</em>mers, and also <em>poly-</em>mers</li>
<li>Dissacharides are small molecules which are easily soluble and easily transportable.</li>
<li>For the a very similar osmotic pressure, dissaccharides carry twice as many electrons as monosaccharides: dissaccharides are the ‘go to’ transport molecules</li>
<li>Sucrose is a non reducing sugar, which allows transportation of a precious cargo in sap very far from where it was produced (think about sequoias!)</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Polyssaccharides or glycans</h3>
<p>Polysaccharides are polymers of monosaccharides linked together thanks to the glycosidic bond, forming sometimes very long chains (at least more than 10 monosaccharides, or else are referred to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligosaccharide">oligosaccharides</a>), either linear or branched.

The term <strong><em>gluc</em></strong><em>an</em> refers to a chain of <strong><em>gluc</em></strong><em>ose</em> monomers, similarly, the term <strong><em>xyl</em></strong><em>an</em>, refers to a chain of <strong><em>xyl</em></strong><em>ose</em> monomers, and so on.</p>
<p>Polysaccharides generally have two main functions: energy storage or structure. Because of the glycosidic bond, which removes a molecule of H<sub>2</sub>O, the general formula for a large polysaccharide is more like (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)<sub>n</sub> often with 200 &lt; n &lt; 3500. For our purpose, it is important to remember that there are three main polysaccharides: homopolysaccharides or homoglycans, i.e., long chains of the same monomers (<em>homo</em>: same), and heteropolysaccharides or heteroglycans, long chains of a variety of monomers (<em>hetero</em>: different), generally separated into hemicelluloses and pectins.</p>

<p>All three molecules are polymers of α- and β D-glucoses. Starch is a polymer of α-D-glucoses linked together by carbons 1 and 4. Glycogen has essentially the same structure, although it has some branches thanks to a bound between carbon 1 and 6 (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:starch-et-al">4.15</a>).</p>

<p>Before we go on on describing the molecular structure of polysaccharides, it is time to reflect on their significance at the planet scale. <strong>Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on earth</strong> <span class="citation">(Klemm et al. <a href="#ref-Klemm2005-hk">2005</a>)</span>. Thanks to the hydrogen bonds between adjacent β-D-glucose polymers, very strong cellulose microfibrils form, themselves bundled into macrofibrils, surrounded by hemicelluloses and lignin (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:cellulose-hemi-lignin">4.16</a>). Cellulose molecules can be hydrolyzed thanks to the cellulase enzyme, generally secreted by bacteria, although animals such as termites do produce a cellulase. Most mammals only have a limited ability to digest cellulose fibers, and even ruminants and monogastric herbivores use symbiotic bacteria to produce cellulase.</p>

<p>So if cellulose is the most abundant molecule on earth, one needs to pause in the structure description of polysaccharides and locate where polysaccharides play a role. Cellulose is the basic structure of plant cell walls. Plant cells, are distinctively different from animal cells because of their <em>cell wall</em>. It is the resemblance with honeycomb cells that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke">Robert Hooke</a> coined the term <em>cell</em> for plants in 1665, the shape being well defined and distinctive thanks to the walls. The cell wall is located <strong>externally</strong> to the plasma membrane and is synthesized by the cell itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Morphologically, the cell wall is formed by layers or sheets. All cells have at least two: middle lamella and primary wall. The middle lamella is synthetized and shared by cells that are contiguous with each other, while the primary cell wall is synthetized and belongs to each cell. In some plant cells, a third thicker layer called secondary cell wall is deposited between the membrane and the primary wall. Most of the wood in the trees correspond to the secondary cell wall (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:plant-cell-walls">4.17</a>) <span class="citation">(Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego <a href="#ref-Pacheco_Megias2013-ov">2013</a>)</span></p>

<p>The outermost layer of the cell wall and the first to form is the middle lamella. It acts as a glue that binds neighboring cells. The middle lamella consists mainly of pectins, although it can be lignified in those cells that have a secondary cell wall. The primary wall consists mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins, glycoproteins. For the cells that have one, the secondary wall consists mainly of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignins <span class="citation">(Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:Pry-Secry-cell-walls">4.18</a>; Pacheco Megías, Molist García, and Pombal Diego <a href="#ref-Pacheco_Megias2013-ov">2013</a>; Loix et al. <a href="#ref-Loix2017-pv">2017</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Pectins are heteroglycans based on galacturonans, or polygalaturonic acids, i.e. polymers of galacturonic acid monomers. For comparison purposes, the difference between glucose and galacturonic acid are illustrated in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:glucose-galacturonic-acid">4.19</a> below. The alcohol functional group of glucose on C6 is oxidized into a carboxylic acid group, and the hydroxyl on C4 changes side.

Pectins also hold cells together. Fruit ripening (becoming softer) or leaf fall, are in part due to the decomposition of pectins by pectinase enzymes. Pectins also seem to play a role during seed germination, and as such also have an energy storage role, particularly thanks to the galactans and arabinans <span class="citation">(Harholt, Suttangkakul, and Vibe Scheller <a href="#ref-Harholt2010-ox">2010</a>; Scheller and Ulvskov <a href="#ref-Scheller2010-ep">2010</a>)</span></p>

<p>Hemicelluloses are heteroglycans or heteropolysaccharides. The hemicellulose term was coined at a time when the structures were not well understood and biosynthesis was completely unknown. Hemicellulose is recognized as a group of wall polysaccharides that are characterized by being neither cellulose nor pectin and by having β-(1→4)- linked backbones of glucose, mannose, or xylose (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:hemicelluloses">4.21</a>). These glycans all have the same equatorial configuration at C1 and C4 and hence the backbones have significant structural similarity <span class="citation">(Scheller and Ulvskov <a href="#ref-Scheller2010-ep">2010</a>)</span>. For those of you who are curious about the ‘equatorial configuration’ term used here, this has to do with the steric configuration of the hydroxyl groups in the cyclic configuration of monosaccharides. This was not even introduced in this chapter, although it is an important consideration for chemists to characterize carbohydrates!</p>

<p>Lignin (from the latin <em>lignum</em>, meaning wood) is, after cellulose, the second most abundant terrestrial biopolymer, accounting for approximately 30% of the organic carbon in the biosphere. The ability to synthesize lignin has been essential in the evolutionary adaptation of plants from an aquatic environment to land. Lignin is crucial for structural integrity of the cell wall and stiffness and strength of the stem. In addition, lignin waterproofs the cell wall, enabling transport of water and solutes through the vascular system, and plays a role in protecting plants against pathogens <span class="citation">(Boerjan, Ralph, and Baucher <a href="#ref-Boerjan2003-sd">2003</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Lignins are polymers of a lot more complex monomers than the monosaccharides presented earlier. The monomers of lignin are called <strong>monolignols</strong>. Nothing to be scared of, because there is no expectation for the reader to know them! Technically, the lignin monomers are generally referred to as phenylpropanoids (which means that there is a phenol radical attached to a propane like C3 structure). The suffix -<em>oid</em> means pseudo), and technically derived from hydroxycinnamyl alcohol differing in their degree of methoxylation, p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:monolignols">4.22</a>).</p>

<p>When introduced in the lignin polymer the corresponding monolignols are named guaiacyl (G), sinapyl (S), and hydroxyl-coumaroyl (H) units, respectively (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:lignins-mono-poly">4.23</a>). The G, S, and H abbreviation letters are often used in the lignin literature. For example, the composition of lignin varies between plant species and tissues. In general, lignins from gymnosperms and related species (called <em>softwood</em> in English) are rich in G units and contains low amounts of H units, whereas lignins of angiosperm dicotyledons (flowing plants with reticulate or network-like leaf veins) are mainly composed of G and S units (corresponding to <em>hardwood</em> in English). For references only and to have some awareness of the diversity of the monomers and polymer units, Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:lignins-mono-poly">4.23</a> has been added above.

<p>On an interesting note, it has recently been shown that polymerization of the monolignols is not random, but that monolignols are first assembled into lignol dimers (two monolignols), referred to as <em>lignans</em>. Lignans are thus dehydrodimers of monolignols <span class="citation">(Davin et al. <a href="#ref-Davin1997-xt">1997</a>; reviewed in Wang et al. <a href="#ref-Wang2013-tw">2013</a>)</span>. There seems to be a plethora of lignans in nature, but exploring the literature on these reveals that some lignans, after ingestion by mamals may have anti-cancer properties! For the record and in case you are fascinated by how things are connected, some of the names and structures of these lignans are rather indicative of where they have been found or associated. For example in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:lignans">4.25</a>, you can see that one of them is called <em>pinoresinol</em>, suggesting links with pine and resin. Another one is called lariciresinol. <em>Larix</em> is the genus name of the larches tree in English. Another one secoisolariciresinol, the prefix <em>secoi-</em>, likely having to do with sequoia, and so on. Podophyllotoxin at the left bottom is found in the toxic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podophyllum">American mandrake, or ground lemon</a> plant, but also on some flax seeds, and seems to be an interesting anti-oxidant for colon cancer <span class="citation">(Fuss <a href="#ref-Fuss2003-ad">2003</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>It would be erroneous to leave out some additional mono- or polyssaccharrides out as some of them play a very significant role in biology and ecology. In a way, they correspond to the exceptions that confirm or rather complete the rule. So far, we have summarized monosaccharides with the general formula (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>n</sub>, to essentially be mostly C5 and C6 molecule where the average carbon is bonded to an hydroxyl functional group and a hydrogen atom. And that these monosaccharides have the tendency to form 5 or 6 atom rings. Well, it turns out that on this general configuration, some of the hydroxyl groups are replaced by other functional groups.</p>
<p>The most famous one is probably is deoxybose, as it replaces ribose, as already mentioned above and illustrated again below (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:ri-deoxy-ribose">4.26</a>).</p>

When an acetyl group is added to the amine group of a glucosamine (via an <a href="functional-groups.html#amides">amide bond</a>), the resulting carbohydrate is called N-acetylglucosamine (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:glucosamine-derivatives">4.27</a>).</p>

The molecule quinovose is a sugar moiety of the <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Quinovin">quinovin molecule</a>, extracted from the bark of the tree of the <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/quinovin"><em>cinchena</em></a> genus in South America. The local Quechuan name is <em>kina</em>, and the new <em>kina</em>, is a <em>quina nova</em>, hence the word <em>quinovin</em> by contraction. And the sugar or ose of the quinovin is thus named a quinovose.</p>

<p>Lipids are fatty acids and their derivatives, and substances related biosynthetically or functionally to these compounds <span class="citation">(Christie <a href="#ref-Christie1987-gu">1987</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the best concise and satisfying definition! The scientific term “lipid” comes from the Greek “lipos” which referred to animal fat or vegetable oil. Lipids are mainly made of C and H atoms, but do also contain O, N, and P. So it is important to remember that lipids are made of <strong>CHONP</strong>. Lipids are a very heterogeneous group of molecules and are defined in part from their propensity to be <em>soluble in non-polar solvents</em> (no net dipole as a result of the opposing charges in the solvent molecules). In other words, lipids do not (or not easily) dissolve in water.</p>
<p>Contrary to carbohydrates, proteins, or nucleic acids, lipids are not obvious polymers of identified and clearly defined monomers. Rather, lipids are assemblages of well identified <strong>building blocks</strong> and <strong>backbones</strong> bonded together with ester, ether, and amide bonds. There are two main types of building blocks resulting in two major types of lipids: lipids built from fatty acid blocks (acyl groups) and lipids based from isoprene building units (ringed or not isoprene groups). Because there is no polymerization, lipids are relatively small molecules compared to polysaccharides, proteins, or nucleic acids.</p>

<p>The carbons of lipids are generally a lot more reduced (have more electrons for themselves) than the ones of carbohydrates. For the latter, there are just about as many oxygen atoms as there are carbons, as a legacy of how they are formed during photosynthesis (details in chapter <a href="photosynthesis.html#photosynthesis">6</a>). Because of the number of oxygen atoms and their reactivity, carbohydrates are only able to form relatively short 5 and 6 carbon monomers, which tend to readily assemble into rings. Polymerization is what allows carbohydrates to form very large molecules.</p>
<p>Lipids aliphatic chains have almost no oxygen atoms instead, and always strategically located near the ends of the chains. Consequently, the carbons of the hydrocarbon chains are not as prompt to react together. The result is that it becomes possible to have longer hydrocarbon molecules (commonly C16 to C22, compared to C5 and C6 carbohydrates). The aliphatic chains are relatively chemically inert and interact together by low level van der Waals forces. These long aliphatic chains are the reasons for the mostly <strong>hydrophobic</strong> character of lipids (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fat-and-oil">4.31</a>).</p>
<p>However, the fatty acid-based lipids are <strong>amphipathic</strong> (also referred to as amphiphilic), i.e., that they have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends. The <em>hydrophobic</em> end or <em>hydrophobic tail</em> corresponds to the long aliphatic chain of the fatty acid residue. The <em>hydrophilic</em> end or <em>hydrophilic head</em> is associated with the other building blocks made of ionic and polar groups that include ester and amide bonds, the backbone, and other polar radicals (details below). The amphiphilic nature of some lipids allows them to form structures such as vesicles, multilamellar/unilamellar liposomes, or membranes in an aqueous environment <span class="citation">(Wikipedia contributors <a href="#ref-Wikipedia_contributors2019-ol">2019</a><a href="#ref-Wikipedia_contributors2019-ol">a</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Overall, lipids function as essential structural components of membranes, as signalling molecules, as chemical identifiers of specific membranes and as energy storage molecules <span class="citation">(Meer, Voelker, and Feigenson <a href="#ref-Van_Meer2008-xa">2008</a>)</span>. Thousands of lipid molecules have been listed and an entire scientific discipline called <em>lipidomics</em> is dedicated to lipids structure and function! Rigorous classifications have been proposed (e.g., <span class="citation">Fahy et al. (<a href="#ref-Fahy2005-gc">2005</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Fahy et al. (<a href="#ref-Fahy2009-ba">2009</a>)</span>), and gateways on lipid research and updates are available (e.g., <a href="http://www.lipidmaps.org/">lipidmaps</a>). Our goal here is to present enough of what lipids are and do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall lipids may be divided into eight categories: fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides (derived from condensation of acyl subunits); and sterol lipids and prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits) <span class="citation">(Wikipedia contributors <a href="#ref-Wikipedia_contributors2019-ol">2019</a><a href="#ref-Wikipedia_contributors2019-ol">a</a>)</span></p>

<p>In this category, are included <strong>fatty acids</strong>, <strong>glycerolipids</strong>, <strong>glycerophospholipids</strong>, <strong>saccharolipids</strong>, and <strong>sphingolipids</strong>. They all have in common the presence of long aliphatic carbon chains forming ‘tails’ of the molecules. The average carbon of a fatty acid chain is a methylene (-CH<sub>2</sub>-) such that each carbon atom has 6 electrons for itself (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:elecalloc-CH2n">4.32</a>).

<p>Lipids share with nucleic acids the ‘building block’ structure, in that they are built of identified building blocks. The quintessential acyl-based lipid is made of two fatty acids forming the <strong>hydrophobic tail</strong> end, a backbone, a phosphate or hexose, and a polar group. The two latter building blocks form the <strong>hydrophilic head</strong>, which tends to be a lot shorter than the hydrophobic end as illustrated in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:lipid-acyl-buildingblock">4.33</a> below.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p></br></p>
<p>From this simple construction, thousands of acyl-based lipid molecules exist following a wide variation on the fatty acids themselves, the three types of backbones, and on the polar groups (nature and number). And there are lots of exception to this general rule <span class="citation">(e.g., Fahy et al. <a href="#ref-Fahy2005-gc">2005</a>, <a href="#ref-Fahy2009-ba">2009</a>)</span>. Nonetheless, Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fatty-acids-based">4.34</a> summarizes how acyl-based lipids are constructed and how some of the classification has been derived. It reads from the bottom to top.</p>
<p>The first stage of molecules having only <em>one</em> of the building blocks are the <strong>fatty acids</strong>. There are so many of them that they are classified as a lipid group by themselves.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p></br></p>
<p>The second stage molecules are lipids built from fatty acids + a backbone. The backbone molecules can bind with one to three fatty acids on one side, with ester (most often), ether, or amide bonds, and with other radicals on the other side allowing more building blocks to be added. There are three main backbone molecules: glycerol, hexosamine (glucosamine in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fatty-acids-based">4.34</a>), and sphingosine. Mono-, di- and triacylglycerols (previously called mono-, di-, and triglycerides, respectively) play such an important role in metabolism and energy storage, that the <strong>glycerolipids</strong> have been identified as a group of its own. Glycerolipids with additional building blocks eventually lead to the <strong>glycerophospholipid</strong> family (green in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fatty-acids-based">4.34</a>). The glucosamine (hexose with an amine group) eventually leads to the <strong>saccharolipid</strong> family (blue in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fatty-acids-based">4.34</a>). Sphingosine plays both the role of a backbone and of a fatty acid thanks to its long saturated aliphatic tail. Sphingosine-based lipids eventually lead to the <strong>sphingolipid</strong> family (grey in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fatty-acids-based">4.34</a>).</p>
<p>The third stage are lipid molecules built from fatty acids + a backbone + phosphate or a sugar. It is quite interesting to realize that only two molecules, phosphate or an hexose, play that role. They have enough hydroxyl functional group to make ester bonds with other groups. Most glycerophospholipids have a fourth stage of building blocks, and the third stage is thus an intermediate form. Many glycolipids and sphingolipids, however, only have stage three molecules and are incorporated into cell membranes as such.</p>
<p>The fourth stage are lipid molecules with four building blocks: fatty acids + a backbone + phosphate or a sugar + polar group. These molecules make about 50% of the cell membranes and thus play a major role in life. It is the amphipathic nature of these molecules that leads them to readily assemble into acyl <strong>lipid bilayers</strong> (generally referred to as phospholipids). The hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads tend to aggregate together forming a layer or sheet of molecules a bit like a bundle of wheat that would have the stems together and the wheat ears together. Because cells essentially are aqueous systems, the hydrophobic side of the layer is naturally unstable, unless it is stabilized by another layer of phospholipids, with the hydrophobic tails facing each other and the hydrophilic heads facing the aqueous phase of the cell (more details later).</p>
<p>Third and fourth stage acyl-based lipids all have similar features: they have a hydrophobic tail group, and a hydrophyllic head group. As a result, they tend to naturally congregate together to form the famous lipid bilayer in which proteins and glycoproteins, serving as cell receptors, catalyzers, or exchange regulators can readily embed.</p>

<strong>In summary:</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Lipids, unlike other molecular families, are not polymers of monomers but are built from building blocks
</li>
<li>
Fatty acid long (C16-C22) saturated or unsaturated chains are the basis of what lipids are, sterols being an exception

<li>
Because there are very few oxygen atoms, carbon atoms have more electrons for themselves and lipids thus serve as energy storage for the cell and organisms

<li>
Most membrane lipids are made of two fatty acids forming a hydrophobic tail, linked to a hydrophilic head, thanks to a backbone intermediate molecule

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.2</span> Lipids as key to cell membrane structure and function</h3>
<p>In this section, lots of concepts are thrown at the reader, whom might be a bit rebuted by so many apparently complicated names (although most of them already appear in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fatty-acids-based">4.34</a>). I decided to present the membrane function first in hope of making the biochemical description of enough of the lipids more interesting. So no worries, read this as a fascinating introduction to the wonders of life, and of lipids!</p>
<p>The first important concept to grasp is that in the lipid bilayer, the adjacent lipid molecules are not bonded together. It is thanks to their hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, and to a lesser degree thanks to electrostatic interactions, that the membrane lipids stay together and that cellular membranes exist altogether. The membrane does not have a solid crystalline nature, but rather a more <strong>fluidic</strong> nature, where molecules can freely move about within their layer or sheet. Proteins can insert themselves into this bilayer system thanks to the <em>fluidic</em> behavior. They too must have some amphipathic properties as well with hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends. Because proteins are inserted in a mosaic pattern, the <strong>fluidic mosaic model</strong> proposed in 1972 [<span class="citation">Singer and Nicolson (<a href="#ref-Singer1972-ng">1972</a>)</span>; Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fluidic-mosaic-bilayer-1972">4.35</a>] was the first accepted model to describe membrane bilayer.</p>

The integral proteins are shown as globular molecules partially embedded in, and partially protruding from, the membrane
</p>
</div>
<p></br></p>
<p>The second important concept is that the diversity of membrane lipids and their layout and interactions together allow the concurrent formation of fluidic and more rigid areas in the membrane itself corresponding to different <em>phases</em>. The two main phases are the <strong>liquid-disordered</strong> phase, very fluidic, almost liquid-like, and the <strong>liquid-ordered</strong> phase, more gel-like and more rigid.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The liquid disordered phase is a highly fluid state in which individual lipids can move laterally across the surface of the membrane relatively unhindered. Liquid-disordered bilayers are often characterized by irregular packing of individual lipid molecules, as well as the presence of kinks in unsaturated fatty acids. These kinks effectively reduce the surface area accessible to other fatty acid chains, weakening van der Waals interactions (<a href="https://phys.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_California_Davis/UCD%3A_Biophysics_241_-_Membrane_Biology/3%3A_Membrane_Phases_and_Morphologies/3.1%3A_Membrane_Phase_Transitions">Membrane Phase Transitions, libretext</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the fatty acid chains are more fully extended because they are more saturated, and/or because they interact with sterols (details below), they become more fully packed and the van der Waals interactions are increased. They yields to a more rigid gel-like structure referred to as the <strong>liquid ordered</strong> phase. And guess what, this is where the proteins are also located and this makes sense because they have a more rigid structure in which to stay (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:lipid-raft-combined">4.36</a>).</p>

<p>In other words, the number of unsaturated bonds in the fatty acid chains have a major impact on how <em>fluidic</em> the membrane is. The more unsaturated, the more kinks, and the more fluidic the membrane. Reversely, the more saturated, the less kinks, the more packed the hydrophobic tails, and the less fluidic the membrane. The addition of sterol lipids tends to generate the more rigid <strong>liquid ordered</strong> phase (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:membrane-lold-harayama">4.37</a>), and these tend to be present where the proteins are embedded in the membrane (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:lipid-raft-combined">4.36</a> and <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:membrane-Sezgin2017">4.38</a>).</p>

<p>Cholesterol, a name that has been used quite a bit until now although not defined, yet, seems to play a major role in membrane rigidity around the membrane nanodomains.

<p>The third important concept is that in addition to lateral heterogeneity around membrane nanodomains, the membrane lipids assemblage dictates the curvature of the membrane and the assemblage is asymetric between the inner and outer leaflets of the membrane (reviewed by <span class="citation">Harayama and Riezman (<a href="#ref-Harayama2018-qr">2018</a>)</span>; Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:membrane-curvature">4.40</a>). The very nature of the membrane lipids leads to a cylindrical shape, a conical shape, or inverted-conical shapes. When assembled together, these shapes allow for membrane curvature and fission (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:membrane-curvature">4.40</a>). Additionally, some membrane lipids such as PhosphatidylSerine (PS), because of the serine (an amino acid) group as the polar group, tends to bind with cytoplasm proteins like actin (considered to be the cytoskeleton, or the skeleton that keeps animal cells together). As a result, PS tends to be on the inner leaflet of the membrane.</p>

<p>The fourth and last important concept is that animal, plant, algal, or bacterial membranes do not have the same membrane lipids. Membrane lipids within an organism may differ from one organelle to the next. For example, the membranes of the thyllakoids, the organelle responsible for photosynthesis, are built with specialized galactolipids. Saccharolipids are found in bacteria only.</p>

<strong>In summary:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It is the amphipathic nature of membrane lipids that allows the formation of a bilayer of acyl-based lipids with the hydrophilic heads facing outwards and the hydrophobic tails facing inward
</li>
<li>
Because acyl-based lipid molecules in each layer are not bonded together, the lipid molecules can move freely within the sheet
</li>
<li>
Proteins are associated with membrane nanodomains where the membrane lipids have a <strong>liquid-order</strong> or gel-like phase and the membrane is more rigid.
</li>
<li>
The membrane nanodomains or lipid rafts are largely enriched in membrane lipids that have straight saturated hydrophobic tails and are enriched with cholesterol
</li>
<li>
It is the straight saturated hydrophobic tails of saturated acyls that shorten distances between molecules and increase van der Waals interactions, resulting in a more rigid structure.
</li>
<li>
Hydrogen-binding between cholesterol and aliphatic tails add to membrane rigidity in these lipid rafts
</li>
<li>
It is the unsaturated bonds in the hydrophobic tail that create kinks in most other membrane lipids, effectively maintaining larger distance between molecules, and weakening the van der Waals interactions, which in the end maintain a <strong>liquid-disordered</strong> of liquid-like phase of the membrane outside the membrane nanodomains
</li>
<li>
The cylindrical or conical shape of the membrane lipids and their lateral placement dictate the curvature and shape of the membrane
</li>
<li>
The presence and nature of proteins on the inner or outer side of the membrane is associated with the assymetry of the assemblages of lipids at the inner and outer leaflets of the membrane

Membrane lipids composition may vary from an organism to another or with organelles within cells

<p>So what are fatty acids afterall? Fatty acid are carboxylic acids with a long aliphatic chain (synonymous to long hydrocarbon chain or alkyl chain), which are either saturated (e.g., palmitic acid in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fatty-acids">4.42</a>), mono-, or poly-unsaturated (i.e., there are at least one double bond between two consecutive carbon atoms, as illustrated in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fatty-acids">4.42</a>; more details in section <a href="functional-groups.html#unsaturated-hydrocarbons">3.1.2</a>). The double bond in the aliphatic chain is rigid and can create ‘kinks’ in the 3D shape and their number and locations are key to their final 3D shape. Most fatty acids in nature have even number of carbons and range from 10 to 22 carbon atoms. Most present in membrane lipids have between 16 and 22 carbon atoms.</p>

<p></br></p>
<p>Fatty acids have been classified according to their carbon-chain length and their level of saturation.</p>
<p>According to their length,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-chain_fatty_acid">Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)</a> have aliphatic chains with less than 6 carbon atoms. Even acetic acid (CH<sub>2</sub>COOH, acid of the vinegar) is classified in this category; so is butyric acid (C4) <img src="pictures/Butyric_acid.png" style="width:10.0%" /> present in butter.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-chain_triglyceride">Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA)</a> are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6 to 12 carbons, which can form medium-chain triglycerides.</li>
<li>Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 13 to 21 carbons. These are the typical molecules to which the generic term is often associated.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_long_chain_fatty_acid">Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)</a> are fatty acids with 22 or more carbons. VLCFA can represent up to a few percent of the total fatty acid content of a cell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fatty acids are then classified depending on whether they are saturated, mono- or polysaturated, but also whether there are some methyl, cyclic, hydroxyl, or nitro radicals in their chains, to name a few. This is way beyond the purpose of this book but many details can be found on <a href="https://www.lipidhome.co.uk/index.html">the LipidWeb</a> maintained by Dr. Christie or classified by Fahy <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Fahy2005-gc">2005</a>, <a href="#ref-Fahy2009-ba">2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In addition to being precursors of other lipids, fatty acids have their own metabolic role. For humans, many fatty acids play essential roles in, e.g., brain activities, cellular messengers, or have been identified to have health benefits. Two fatty acids are considered <strong>essential fatty acids</strong> for humans, i.e., that humans need them but lack the ability to synthesize them (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:essential-FA">4.43</a>).</p>

<div id="the-famous-omega-3-and-omega-6-fatty-acids" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.5.3.2</span> The famous omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids</h4>
<p>The Alpha Linoleic Acid (ALA) is an <strong>omega-3</strong> fatty acid. This very common everyday life denomination gives the opportunity to introduce some nomenclature and fascinating facets of fatty acids. As stated before, in organic chemistry in general, each carbon is given a number, carbon number 1 starting with the most important functional group. As a result, in fatty acids, the carbon of the carboxyl group is given the value “1” (blue numbers in Figures <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fatty-acids">4.42</a> and <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:essential-FA">4.43</a>). In unsaturated fatty acids, the number and location of the double bond(s) are very important because, again, it influences the 3D shape of the aliphatic chains (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fatty-acids">4.42</a>) and is reflected in the naming.</p>
<p>So the first approach to name fatty acid is to follow organic chemistry rules. For example, linoleic acid is a 18 carbon molecule and has two unsaturated bonds. The corresponding alkane is an <strong><em>octadec</em></strong>ane, <em>octadec-</em> prefix meaning 18. But it also is a carboxylic acid, so the suffix will be <em>-oic</em>. It has two unsaturated bonds, so it is a <em>di</em><strong><em>ene</em></strong>, <em>di-</em> for 2, and <strong><em>-ene</em></strong> for alk<strong><em>ene</em></strong>. The placement of the unsaturated bonds are on the 9th and 12th carbon. So its name is a 9,12-<em>octadec</em><strong><em>dien</em></strong>oic acid or <em>octadec</em><strong><em>-9,12-dien</em></strong>oic acid!! OK, but this does not really explain the <em>omega</em> part.</p>
<p>In molecules of 16 to 22 carbons, it became obvious to chemists that it was just as easy to count from the other end or methyl end (fewer carbons to count!) to locate the double bonds. So they started to also report counting from the methyl end. Since “the alpha and the omega” is a known biblical expression meaning “the beginning and the end”, the “alpha” of the fatty acid became the beginning of the aliphatic chain (i.e., carbon number 2, see α linolenic acid in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:essential-FA">4.43</a>), and the “omega” became the end carbon of the aliphatic chain. The expression “omega-3” really means “omega <em>minus</em> 3”, or that the last unsaturated bond is located at three carbons from the end.</p>
<p>But what about the other double bond(s)? How does one know where it is (they are) located? Well, it turns out that for most polyunsaturated fatty acids, the double bonds are located every 3 carbons! Such that the carbons on each side of the double bonds are in the <em>cis</em> configuration, or that they ‘face’ each other rather than being on the oposite side of the double bond (in which case they would be in a <em>trans</em> configuration, further description in section <a href="functional-groups.html#unsaturated-hydrocarbons">3.1.2</a>). So lipid chemists have come up with much simplified nomenclature and the linoleic acid would then be referred to as a 18:2(n-3). This means that the fatty acid has 18 carbons, has 2 unsaturated bonds, the last one is the third carbon from the end (n-3, n replaces ω in most modern naming). And because there are no further precisions, all the double bonds are in a <em>cis</em> configuration and therefore the other double bond is at an (n-6) location. Voilà!</p>
<p>The omega-3 fatty acids are a gateway to health sciences and medicine! Briefly, the two essential fatty acids cited above serve as precursor to other very important fatty acids. The first notable one is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachidonic_acid">arachidonic acid</a> (20:4(n-6)). The name arachidonic acid suggests that this acid is particularly present in peanut oil. You should now be able to write its formula before you check it out and verify it from Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fatty-acids">4.42</a>! Arachidonic acid is the preponderant fatty acid included in the membrane phospholipids. It is also the presursor of very important C20 and C22 fatty acids, building blocks of membrane phospholipids of the brain. In fact, there is high probability that you might have heard about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosapentaenoic_acid">EPA</a> (eicosapentenoic acid 20:5(n-3), <em>eicos-</em> meaning 20, <em>-penten-</em> meaning five double bonds), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid">DHA</a> (docosahexaenoic acid 22:6(n-3); <em>docos-</em> meaning 22, <em>-hexaen-</em> meaning six double bonds). With ALA, EPA and DHA are the most talked and researched after omega-3 lipids!! And indeed, there are lots of evidence that these omega-3 are good for human health <span class="citation">(e.g., Kris-Etherton, Hecker, and Binkoski <a href="#ref-Kris-Etherton2004-ju">2004</a>)</span>. Many conjugated (i.e., alternating single and double bonds; double bonds in <em>trans</em> configuration) polyunsaturated fatty acids have also recently been reported to have health benefits <span class="citation">(e.g., Pariza, Park, and Cook <a href="#ref-Pariza2000-wk">2000</a>; Kris-Etherton, Hecker, and Binkoski <a href="#ref-Kris-Etherton2004-ju">2004</a>; Benjamin and Spener <a href="#ref-Benjamin2009-ei">2009</a>)</span> .</p>
<p>Because arachidonic acid is so widely needed and available, it is also the precursor of an entire family of fatty acid derivatives referred to as the <strong>eicos</strong>anoid lipids (eicos- meaning 20, -oid meaning “like” or “derivatives”). These are oxidated fatty acids (then referred to as <em>oxylipins</em>) that serve as cellular messengers in mammalians. Their names might be familiar and include prostaglandins (vasodilators) or thromboxanes (vasoconstrictors).</p>

<div class="rmd-study">
<p>
<strong>In summary:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Fatty acids are carboxylic acids so technically even acetic acid (C2) or butyric acid (C4, in butter) are fatty acids.
</li>
<li>
Their hydrophobicity comes from their relative long aliphatic chains (C10 and up)
</li>
<li>
Saturated fatty acids have straight aliphatic chains and take little 3D space
</li>
<li>
The number and placement of unsaturated (C=C) bonds dictates their 3D shapes from a simple kink like in oleic acid to almost snail like shape for DHA
</li>
<li>
When a moeity of membrane acyl-based lipids, the nature and therefore shape of the fatty acids dictates the fluidity or rigidity of the membrane

<p></br></p>
<p>Triacylglycerols are the quintessential model for the fat lipids (e.g., Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fat-and-oil">4.31</a>). They are assemblages of long chain fatty acids esterified to a glycerol backbone (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:triacylglycerol">4.44</a>). Fatty acids very loosely represent the equivalent of monomers in lipids, but the ester bonds do not represent true polymerization as the fatty acids are not directly bonded together, but are bonded to a backbone instead.</p>
<p>Glycerolipids give the opportunity to reintroduce the term <strong>moiety</strong>. In a triacylglycerol, the glycerol <em>moiety</em> refers to as the part of the triacylglycerol that comes from the glycerol, illustrated in red in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:triacylglycerol">4.44</a>. Lipids and nucleic acid monomers are assemblages of recognizable building blocks and each block in the final molecule is referred to as a moiety. The other moieties of triacylglycerol are the fatty acids.</p>
<p>There is an entire classification of triacylglycerols depending on which glycerol atom is bonded to which fatty acid. But that is beyond what is needed here. The word triacylglycerol has been preferred over the older <em>triglycerides</em>.</p>
<p>The equivalent of glycerolipids for the sugar backbone and sphingosine are covered in the sections below dedicated to saccharolipids and sphingolipids, respectively.</p>

<p>The next stage of building blocks after the glycerolipids is the addition of a phosphate moiety to a diacylglycerol via a phosphoester bond with the remaining hydroxyl group of the glycerol moiety (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:phosphatidic-acid-formation">4.45</a>) to form <strong>phosphatidic acid</strong>. This molecule is an intermediate molecule for the synthesis of glycerophospholipids, built from the addition of, a least, another polar group building block.</p>

</div>
<p></br></p>
<p>Notice that because phosphoric acid has three hydroxyl groups, it can theoretically make up to 3 ester bonds. In reality, this does not happen in organic molecules for several reasons. First, the tetrahedral shape of phosphate renders difficult the possibility of binding three aliphatic chains. Second, the electronic resonance makes the third hydroxyl much less attractive to forming bonds when the two others are already involved in bonds. So, for the vast majority of cases, phosphates can only form up to two phosphoester bonds.</p>
<p>Phosphatidic acid has two hydroxyls available for additional binding, and one of them is used to bind with the fourth stage building blocks constituted by polar groups. The phosphatidic acid becomes a substituent to the polar group and the resulting molecules are then referred to as <em>phosphati</em><strong>dyl</strong> <em>polar group name</em>. These are the famous phospholipids that make the majority of the membrane bilayer of most plants, animals and bacteria. Another group called the <strong>glycolipids</strong> have a sugar instead of a phosphate moiety on the third stage. They are treated separately after the four stage phospholipid molecules below.</p>
</div>
<div id="phospholipids" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.5.5.2</span> The main membrane phospholipids</h4>
<p>The quintessential phospholipid is illustrated in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:lipid-acyl-buildingblock">4.33</a> and is the single unit of the membrane bilayer. Again, it is thanks to its hydrophobic double tail and its hydrophylic head that the phospholipids assemble into phospholipid sheets and into phospholipid bilayers. Two of the glycerol backbone carbons are linked to fatty acids, and the third to the phosphate moeity. There are three theoretical possibilities for this assemblage. In reality, it turns out that the placement of the fatty acyl and the phosphate ester bonds on the glycerol backbone is anything but random.</p>
<p>Chemists have thus given <strong>stereospecific numbering</strong> or <strong><em>sn</em></strong> to represent this fact. The word stereospecific has to do with the 3D configuration as rendered by the Fisher projection of the glycerol. But for us, the important fact is that the carbons of the glycerol are numbered and that the phosphate moeity is <strong>always</strong> bonded to the third carbon or is on <em>sn-3</em>. The only exception is the lysobisphosphatidic acid, where the phosphate moiety is on <em>sn-1</em> <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, on the first carbon of the glycerol, or on <em>sn-1</em> the fatty acyl is <strong>most often</strong> saturated, and it is on the second carbon, or <em>sn-2</em> that unsaturated fatty acyls may be found. This is why in all the previous figures that represented phospholipids with a bead for the hydrophilic head and lines for the tails, there always is one of the tails represented as straight, illustrating the saturated fatty acyl on <em>sn-1</em> and the second tail is either straight or kinked representing the saturated or unsaturated fatty acyl, respectively, on <em>sn-2</em>.</p>
<p>The diversity of phospholipids results primarily from the different assemblages of the fatty acyl on <em>sn-1</em> and <em>sn-2</em>, and on the polar group of the hydrophilic head. There are additional phospholipids that do not strictly follow this 4-stage molecular assemblage (details below). It turns out that although there is an almost infinite number of possible combinations, in practice, some polar groups combine with a limited number of saturated and unsaturated acyl groups.</p>

<p>Among the 4-stage phopsholipids, there are five well identified polar groups, which include <strong>ethanolamine</strong>, <strong>serine</strong>, <strong>choline</strong>, <strong>inositol</strong>, and <strong>glycerol</strong>. Because each of these polar groups are bound to <em>phosphatidic acid</em> via a phosphoester bond, they are called, respectively, <em>phosphatidyl</em><strong>ethanolamine</strong> (PtdE), <em>phosphatidyl</em><strong>serine</strong> (PtdSer), <em>phosphatidyl</em><strong>choline</strong> (PtdChl), <em>phosphatidyl</em><strong>inositol</strong> (PtdIno), and <em>phosphatidyl</em><strong>glycerol</strong> (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:glycerophospholipids">4.46</a>).</p>
<p><em>Phosphatidyl</em><strong>choline</strong> (PtdChl) is the most abundant lipid in the membranes of animal tissues; it is often a major lipid component of plant membranes, but only rarely of bacteria. With the other choline-containing phospholipid, sphingomyelin, it is a key structural component and constitutes much of the lipid in the <strong>external monolayer</strong> of the plasma membrane of animal cells especially <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>. Choline is an ethanolamine (see below) for which the amine group is in its cationic from (i.e., -NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>) and where the hydrogens have been replaced by methyl groups to create (-N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>). The positive charge on the nitrogen is compensated by the negative charge on the phosphate, making PtdChl a neutral phospholipid. The fatty acids on <em>sn-1</em> tend to be 16:0 and 18:0 for both animal and plant cells, and 18:1 and 18:2 on <em>sn-2</em> <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>, so relatively small number of unsaturated bonds compared to other phospholipids. PtdChl is rarely being found in bacteria, although it is often the main complex lipid in eukaryotes <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Phosphatidyl</em><strong>ethanolamine</strong> (PtdE) is usually the second most abundant phospholipid class in animal and plant tissues, and it can be the major lipid class in microorganisms <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>. Ethanolamine corresponds to an ethane or C2 with one hydroxyl group (-OH) on one carbon making <em>ethanol</em>, and an amine group (-NH<sub>2</sub>) on the second carbon; the two combined is called ethanolamine. It is bound to the phosphate via a phosphoester bond. The amine group in PtdE tends to be in its cationic form, making PtdE also a neutral phospholipid. The fatty acids tend to mimic those of PtdChl although there is a higher proportion of polyunsaturated (e.g., 20:4) acyls on <em>sn-2</em> for animal cells. PtdE is often the most abundant lipid class in many bacterial species and may be accompanied by phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylglycerol <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Phosphatidyl</em><strong>serine</strong> (PtdSer) is a weakly acidic lipid that is present in most tissues of animals and plants and is also found in microorganisms. Under normal conditions, it is located entirely in the <strong>inner monolayer</strong> leaflet of the plasma membrane and other cellular membranes <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>. Serine is an amino-acid (details in section <a href="molecular-families.html#proteins">4.3</a>) and tends to readily bind to proteins within and outside the membrane with cytoplasmic proteins such as actins making the cytoskeleton of animal cells. The fatty acids on <em>sn-1</em> tend to be 18:0 for animal cells, and be long polyunsaturated 20:4 and 22:6 on <em>sn-2</em> <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>, so relatively high number of unsaturated bonds compared to other phospholipids.</p>
<p><em>Phosphatidyl</em><strong>inositol</strong> (PtdIno) is a common constituent of animal, plant and microbial lipids. Inositol is an interesting carbohydrate: it is a cyclohexane, for which each carbon has been oxidized and lost a hydrogen for a hydroxyl (-OH). So it has six alcohol groups or is an hex<em>ol</em>, with the same general formula as glucose, i.e. C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. Glucose has an aldehyde group on its 6<sup>th</sup> carbon and is thus different. In animal tissues, the characteristic feature of fatty acids is a high content of stearic (18:0) and arachidonic (20:4) acids. The long tails of arachidonic acids from PtdIno on both sides of the membrane seems to be able to form hydrogen bonds, participating in the liquid-ordered phase of membranes (e.g., Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:membrane-lold-harayama">4.37</a>). The hydroxyl groups of inositol react with phosphate to from inositol mono-, bi- or even tri-phosphates, all of which PtdIno play, in animal cells, important signalling and other functional activities, including cell communication via signal transduction, cell survival and proliferation, membrane trafficking and modulation of gene expression <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>. Phosphatidylinositols also serve as anchors to proteins (see protein anchor in Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:lipid-raft-combined">4.36</a>) in animal cells.</p>
<p>While the previous phospholipids are common in eukaryot cells, bacterial cells tend to have different types and proportions of phospholipids.</p>
<p><em>Phosphatidyl</em><strong>glycerol</strong> is a lipid present in the three kingdoms of life although it is a major component of some bacterial membranes. The charge on the phosphate group means that it is an anionic lipid at neutral pH with a larger head group than might be expected because of hydration and with a cylindrical shape overall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Phosphatidylglycerol is found in almost all anaerobic bacterial types, representing 20-25% of the phospholipids in most Gram-negative bacteria, i.e. with a double (outer and inner) phospholipid envelope, where it is present only in the inner membrane. In Gram-positive bacteria, which have a single phospholipid bilayer coated with peptidoglycans, it can be as high as 60% of the phospholipids (together with glycosyl diacylglycerols). In cyanobacteria and plants that are able to carry out aerobic photosynthesis, phosphatidylglycerol is found in all cellular membranes - 2 to 5% of the plasma membrane. In bacteria, phosphatidylglycerol especially is widely distributed and it is found in most genera; uniquely it is the only glycerophospholipid in the membranes of certain cyanobacteria <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last of the phospholipids presented here is <strong>cardiolipin</strong>, which was originally found in animal heart tissue (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:glycerophospholipids">4.46</a>). It can be seen as the condensation of two <em>phosphatidyl</em><strong>glycerol</strong> molecules into one. Cardiolipin is present universally in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes where it represents an important phospholipid component of specific membranes in those organelles whose function is to generate an electrochemical potential for substrate transport and ATP synthesis. Thus, it is found almost exclusively in certain membranes of bacteria (plasma membrane and hydrogenosomes) and a few species of Archaea (haloarchaea), and in mitochondria of eukaryotes (up to 20% of phospholipids) <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>. This phospholipid is rather negative thanks to the two negative charges of the phosphate, which may explain its role in maintaining electrochemical potentials across the membranes (see Chapter <a href="aerobic-and-anaerobic-respiration.html#aerobic-and-anaerobic-respiration">5</a>).</p>
<p>There are other phospholipids described in exhaustive classifications, but this is beyond the scope of this book. Additional references include <a href="https://www.lipidhome.co.uk/index.html">the LipidWeb</a>, <span class="citation">Fahy et al. (<a href="#ref-Fahy2005-gc">2005</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Fahy et al. (<a href="#ref-Fahy2009-ba">2009</a>)</span> as good starters.</p>
<p>Phospholipids by definition involve phosphate as a central moiety between the backbone and the polar group. This is one of the reasons for which phosphorus and phosphate in particular are so essential for life to exist on this planet. However, we will see that phosphorus in reality is not readily available in many areas of our planet and this is why it has historically been a <strong>limiting nutrient</strong> on our planet for the longest time. This has recently changed (since the late 1950s) thanks to the mining and manufacturing of artificial fertilizers. However, because phosphorus was in so short supply, organisms have found ways to still build their membranes using the building block principle, but without using phosphate, and using hexoses instead.</p>

The sugar moeity, because it is linked via this glycosidic bond is called a <em>glycosyl</em> group, hence the name (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:glycosyldiacylglycerol">4.47</a>).

<strong>In summary:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Phospholipids are the core molecules that form membranes that allow compartmentalization in cells essential to life as they regulate exchanges and allow formation of gradients
</li>
<li>
This is possible thanks to the unique assemblage of two long chain fatty acids on a glycerol backbone forming the hydrophobic side, and on the other side, a phosphate and a polar group resulting in a hydrophilic side
</li>
<li>
The overall charge of the phospholipids depend on whether the negative charge of the phosphate is balanced or not by the charge of the positive charge of the polar group.
</li>
<li>
Phosphatidylcholine is the most common phospholipids in eukaryot and prokaryot cells. Some organelles and cells can contain high proportion of specific phopholipids like the cardiolipin in organelles maintaining electrochemical potentials across the membrane
</li>
<li>
There is a relative correlation between the fatty acid types and the polar groups

<li>
Phosphate limited environements have lead certain bacteria and cyanobacteria to develop fatty acylglycerol-based membrane lipids that use sugars instead of phosphates

<div id="sphingolipids" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.6</span> Sphingolipids use sphingosine as backbone/fatty acid</h3>
<p>The second major type of acyl-based lipids are called <strong>sphingolipids</strong>. From their original discovery from brain cells in the 1880s to modern times, sphingolipids have shown some enigmatic traits <span class="citation">(Thudichum <a href="#ref-Thudichum1884-mb">1884</a>; Merrill et al. <a href="#ref-Merrill1997-my">1997</a>; Spiegel and Milstien <a href="#ref-Spiegel2003-lt">2003</a>)</span>. The original building block is <strong>sphingosine</strong> (C18). This molecule originally discovered in brain has many of the traits of saturated fatty acids because of its long saturated aliphatic chain, yielding the same hydrophobic properties of fatty acid tails. Carbons 1 and 3 are oxydized into alcohol groups, carbon 2 has an amine group, while there is a double bond between carbons 4 and 5 (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:sphingolipids">4.49</a>). The amine group can react with the carboxyl group of a fatty acid to form an <em><a href="amides">amide bond</a></em>, to form <strong>ceramide</strong>, which is the equivalent of diacylglycerol or second stage molecules described above. The prefix <em>cer-</em> in <em>ceramide</em> has its roots in the word <em>cerebral</em>, for brain, following the early discoveries. The amide bond is rather rigid thanks to the partial double bond between the amine and the carbonyl functional groups (details in section <a href="functional-groups.html#amides">3.2.10</a>), which reduces the aliphatic chain fluctuations. This with the added rigidity thanks to cholesterol molecules (details in seciion <a href="molecular-families.html#sterols">4.5.11</a> below), shortens the intermolecular distances between sphingomyelin molecules and facilitates the formation of hydrogen bonds between them thereby promoting the formation of a hydrogen bond network and a stable ordered phase <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>. The hydroxyl group on carbon 1 can bind with polar groups such as phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine, or sugars (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:sphingolipids">4.49</a>).</p>
<p>As a result, sphingosine serves as a backbone because it can bind with a fatty acid on the hydrophobic tail end and with a polar group to form a hydrophilic head. Sphingosine also plays the role of a second fatty acid thanks to its hydrophobic saturated tail. Sphingosine is the most prevalent of the many (over one hundred!) <strong>sphingoid bases</strong> that have been identified, which differ depending on the number of carbons, whether there are two (or d- for <em>di-</em>) or three (or t- for <em>tri-</em>) hydroxyl groups, and whether there is, and the location of, a unsaturated C=C double bond, to keep it short. Sphingosine has its unsaturated bond between carbons 4 and 5, and in the <em>trans</em> or <em>E</em> (for German <em>Entgegen</em>) configuration (details in section <a href="functional-groups.html#unsaturated-hydrocarbons">3.1.2</a>). Sphingosine is thus abbreviated as 4E-d18:1, meaning 4E for unsaturated bond starting on carbon 4 with the <em>Entgegen</em> configuration, <em>d</em> because there are two hydroxyls on C1 and C3 (the amine group is always on C2 in sphingoid bases), 18:1 for a C18 aliphatic chain overall and one unsaturated bond. For example, bases include dihydrosphingosine which is a d18:1, phytosphingosine which is a t18:1, and dehydrophytosphingosine which is a 7E-t18:1 <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Many polar groups have been identified for sphingolipids including phosphocholine or phosphoethanolamine, for which the resulting lipids are called <strong>sphingomyelins</strong>. Sugar based polar groups form a great variety of molecules referred to as <strong>glycosphingolipids</strong> that are very important in brain tissues.</p>
<p>More generally, however, sphingolipids play a very important role in the membrane nanodomains, where in conjuction with cholesterol, form the liquid-ordered, gel-like phase, membrane proteins are inserted (details in section <a href="molecular-families.html#membrane-lipids">4.5.2</a>). The fatty acids of sphingolipids are very different from those of glycerolipids, consisting of very-long-chain (up to C26) odd- and even-numbered saturated or monoenoic <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>. This additionally renders the ceramide residue to have a cylindrical shape (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:fatty-acids">4.42</a>), which, in conjunction with hydrogen bonding between cholesterol and the sphingoid base residues, increase the van der Waals electrostatic forces, and favor the liquid-ordered phase of the membrane nanodomains. Finally, sphingolipids play an important, yet still relatively enigmatic, signalling function in animal organisms <span class="citation">(Spiegel and Milstien <a href="#ref-Spiegel2003-lt">2003</a>)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.7</span> Saccharolipids in bacterial membranes</h3>
<p>The last group of acyl-based lipids include <strong>saccharolipids</strong>, where the backbone for attaching the acyl chains are sugars, namely <strong>glucosamines</strong> and sometimes <strong>glucosamine disaccharides</strong> or sugar dimers (hence the prefix <em>saccharo-</em> for sugar backbone, by opposition to <em>glycero-</em> for glycerol backbone in glycerolipids; <span class="citation">Fahy et al.

Endotoxins are toxins for most animals. They are attached to the bacteria membranes themselves, as opposed to exotoxins that are released by bacteria in their environments. When bacterial cells are lysed by the mamalian immune system, fragments of membrane containing lipid A are released into the circulation, causing fever, diarrhea, and possible fatal endotoxic shock (also called septic shock). The Lipid A moiety is a very conserved component of the endotoxins. However Lipid A structure varies among bacterial species and Lipid A structure defines an overall host immune activation, sometimes violent <span class="citation">(Wikipedia contributors <a href="#ref-Wikipedia_contributors2019-bp">2019</a><a href="#ref-Wikipedia_contributors2019-bp">f</a>)</span>.

<p>Archeabacteria, considered as the first phylogenic organism group, and now considered as one of the three groups with eubacteria and eukaryots, have membrane acyl-based lipids where the hydrophobic tails are bonded to the hydrophilic backbone through <strong><em>ether</em></strong> bond, and not ester bonds anymore <span class="citation">(De Rosa and Gambacorta <a href="#ref-De_Rosa1988-xd">1988</a>)</span>. Additionally, their fatty acids are built upon isoprenoid chains (further details on isoprenoids in section <a href="molecular-families.html#isoprenoids">4.5.10</a>), i.e., in this case saturated chains methylated every 4 carbons. This must affect the fluidity of the membrane.</p>

<p>Possibly more surprising and showing how cell membranes evolved, the core membrane lipids of archeobacteria are bipolar amphipatic molecules with ‘fused’ hydrophobic isoprenoid tails, bonded with ether bonds to the hydrophilic heads on opposite sides to form isoprenoid tetraethers, and, have cyclic rings inserted in the isoprenoid tails. This can only add rigidity to the membrane, a feature that is obtained in eukaryotic cells with sphingolipids combined with cholesterol lipids.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.8</span> Summary about the acyl-based-lipids</h3>
<p>Broadly, acyl-based lipids are at the basis of cell membrane formation, and serve as the energy storage molecules in organisms. Their long mostly-saturated aliphatic chains are able to store many electrons, which are physically stored as triacylglycerols in organisms as there are few free fatty acids. The long aliphatic chains are the reasons for the general hydrophobicity of lipids. The magic of these fatty acids (and sphingosine tails) is their ability to bind with more polar groups such as phosphate, choline, inositol, etc., thanks to a molecular backbone, giving many of the acyl-based lipids their amphipathic nature. This is the basis of all compartmentilization in living cells by the phospholipid bilayer, allowing for the creation of gradients, exchanges, barriers, etc., all needed to form organisms of several to billions of cells that need to interact and communicate together.</p>
<p>This concludes the part on acyl-based lipids. The next part explores the lipids which structures are originally based on chains of isoprene subunits. They play a complementary role of acyl-based lipids in membranes and play a major role as messengers, e.g., in the form of vitamins and hormones.</p>

<p>Everyone has heard about steroids. And everyone has heard about cholesterol. These are <em>sterol-based</em> lipids. They belong to a larger group of molecules, which includes prenol-based and steroid-based lipids, which have <strong>isoprene</strong> units as their common <em>molecular skeleton</em>. So no, you did not read <em>monomer</em>, you read <em>unit</em>, but honestly it would be tempting to use the term <em>isoprene monomer</em> and <em>polymerization of isoprenes</em> to form <em>isoprenoid</em> molecules or <em>terpenes</em> (literally derivatives of isoprenes) and their derivatives which include prenol-based and steroid-based lipids.</p>
<p>If you thought that the acyl-based lipids were complicated, think again, because prenol-based and steroid-based lipids will take you to the next level in the intricacy of lipid chemistry! At the same time, it really is fascinating and it opens the doors to molecules and name we have all heard about: vitamins or essential oils.</p>

<strong>Etymology Corner</strong>
</p>
<p>
The words <em>isoprene</em> and <em>terpene</em> have rather convoluted etymologies. In 1860, the English scientist and analytical chemist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Greville_Williams">Charles Greville Williams</a> analyzed caoutchouc and gutta percha (latex from the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaquium">Palaquium</a></em> tree) by destructive distillation and obtained a large quantity of a light oil which he termed <strong><em>isoprene</em></strong> <span class="citation"><span class="citation">(Williams <a href="#ref-Williams1860-rm">1860</a>)</span></span>. The term isoprene can be analyzed from iso- (“equal; different, isomeric”) + prop- (“three carbon prefix”) + -ene (“alkene suffix”). It is really unclear how Williams came up with this name. This is an unfortunate misnomer.
</p>
<p>
The word <em>terpene</em> is derived from the word “terpentine”, an obsolete form of the word “turpentine” <span class="citation"><span class="citation">(Wikipedia contributors <a href="#ref-Wikipedia_contributors2019-vc">2019</a><a href="#ref-Wikipedia_contributors2019-vc">h</a>)</span></span>. The latter seems to come from the Latin/French <em>térébenthine</em>, and Greek <em>terebenthos</em> (τ ε ρ ε β ι ́ ν θ ι ν ο ς), referring to the resin of the terebinth tree <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistacia_terebinthus">Pistacia terebinthus</a></em>, which produces the pistachio nut. Turpentine resins, secreted by resinous trees to protect wounds or cuts in the trunks, has been harvested throughout the world. The one harvested from the long leaf pines (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longleaf_pine">Pinus lacustris</a></em>) of the coastal plain of the Eastern USA was highly sought after from the 17<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. It made the wealth of cities like Wilmington, N.C., along with tar and pitch (sticky liquids produced by burning pine branches and logs very slowly in kilns <span class="citation"><span class="citation">(History <a href="#ref-noauthor_undated-qt">2012</a>)</span></span>) used in the naval industry.
</p>
<p>
The pine resin, after purification and distillation, separates into a liquid aromatic part, turpentine or oil of turpentine, and a solid part called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosin">rosin or colophony</a>. Rosin is extensively used (among many others) for its friction-increasing capacity, particularly on bow hair of string instruments so it can grip the strings and make them speak, or vibrate clearly. Turpentine oil was used in making paint, paint thinner, and various medicines <span class="citation"><span class="citation">(History <a href="#ref-noauthor_undated-qt">2012</a>)</span></span>. Many terpene molecules described in this chapter are present in the oil of turpentine.

<p>So isoprene is a C5 double unsaturated molecule (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:isoprene-GPP">4.57</a>), which animals and plants produce, the latter to protect leaf cells against extreme heat. It turns out that it is the assemblage of two isoprene units bonded to a pyrophosphate (called geranyl pyrophosphate - GPP; Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:isoprene-GPP">4.57</a>) that is the beginning of many isoprenoids, otherwise also named <em>terpenes</em> (etymology explained above).</p>

<p>The name for the family comes from the alcohol version of isoprene, called <em>prenol</em> (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:isoprene-GPP">4.57</a>), where the hydroxyl group takes advantage of the original double bond on the tail of the molecule (carbon 4; Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:isoprene-GPP">4.57</a>), which relocates the remaining double bond between carbons 2 and 3 (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:isoprene-GPP">4.57</a>).

<p>Because geranyl-pyrophosphate is the initial building block of most terpenes, and because it has two isoprene units (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:isoprene-GPP">4.57</a>), terpenes tend to have even numbers of isoprene units (although there are many isoprenoids with odd numbers of isoprene units, e.g. Table <a href="molecular-families.html#tab:terpene-tab">4.1</a>). <em>Hemi</em>terpenes, <em>Mono</em>terpenes, <em>Sesqui</em>terpenes, <em>di</em>terpenes, <em>tri</em>terpenes, and <em>tetra</em>terpenes respectively refer to isoprenoids with 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 isoprene subunits (Table <a href="molecular-families.html#tab:terpene-tab">4.1</a>).</p>

<p>The propensity of prenols to form cycles is at the basis of the formation for example of the <em>lanosterol</em>, precursor of all steroid lipids, from squalene (a common oil found in shark liver; Table <a href="molecular-families.html#tab:terpene-tab">4.1</a> and Figure <a href="#fig:lanosterol-formation"><strong>??</strong></a>). Vitamin A (retinol) is a bi-product of β-carotene, both of which exhibit carbon rings (Table <a href="molecular-families.html#tab:terpene-tab">4.1</a>). Carotene is a photosynthetic pigment important for photosynthesis absorbing in the ultraviolet, violet, and blue light and scatter orange or red light, and (in low concentrations) yellow light. Carotene is responsible for the orange color of the carrots (hence its name) and many other fruits and vegetables. As a precursor to vitamin A, carotenes, must be ingested by humans. Xanthophylls are photosynthetic pigments giving the yellow color, even in egg yolk, located mostly in leaves where they act to modulate light energy. They are very close to, and essentially are oxygenated versions of carotenes (Table <a href="molecular-families.html#tab:terpene-tab">4.1</a>).</p>
<p>The cycling propensity of isoprenoids also exist for many aromatic terpenes referred to as <em>essential oils</em>. Contrary to what the word <em>essential</em> means for fatty acids or amino acids, i.e., that humans do not synthesize them and must be acquired through food, <em>essential oils</em> refer to the propensity of these molecules to become very volatile and contain the “essence of” the plant’s fragrance. Molecules such as <em>geraniol</em> are found on the leaves of geranium plants, <em>geranial or citral</em> give a strong lemon (citrus) odor, <em>limonene</em> is found in many citrus plants, <em>pinene</em> in pine, <em>thymol</em> in thyme, <em>menthol</em> in mint (actually a terpenoid because it has an oxygen atom, and not a terpene <em>sensu stricto</em>, which have only carbon atoms), <em>humalene</em> in <em>humulus lupulus</em> or hops in Latin, etc. In fact, many students have heard about terpenes because they are synthesized on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichome">trichomes</a> or plant hair of cannabis leaves, and offer various aromas for their use, along with possible medical benefits.</p>
<p>Isoprene and many essential oils, being very volatile, are closely involved in production of the air pollutant, ozone. In addition, when they are oxidized by atmospheric ozone, ·OH, or NO<sub>x</sub> radicals, aerosols may form that cause scattering of the sunlight; since the intensity of the scattering is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(1/ \lambda^4\)</span>, the short wavelengths λ are enhanced in the scattered light, making it look blue (Rayleigh scattering). This is the main explanation for, e.g., the appearance and the name of the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina which hosts many conifer species.</p>
<p>Some authors question whether the ‘essential oils’ and many terpenoids belong to the lipid family at all (e.g., <span class="citation">Christie (<a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>), but we thought that it was a missed opportunity not to mention them here.</p>

Because of this distinction, phyto- and zoosterols are a bit different. Sterol and steroid lipids all have fused rings and a planar geometry, which gives them rigidity and strength. As a result, they play an essential role in membrane stability and particularly in lipid rafts where the membrane has less a fluidic property, and more of gel like properties (details in section <a href="molecular-families.html#membrane-lipids">4.5.2</a>).</p>

<p>Among the most remarkable sterol lipids are the steroid hormones, and particularly the sex hormones and cholecalciferol hormone better known as vitamin D.</p>
<p>Estradiol and testoterones have lost the aliphatic chain of the reference cholesterol. Estradiol is a naturally occurring hormone that circulates endogenously within the human body. It is the most potent form of mammalian estrogenic steroids and acts as the major female sex hormone. As such, estradiol plays an essential role in the regulation of the menstrual cycle, in the development of puberty and secondary female sex characteristics, as well as in ageing and several hormonally-mediated disease states. Testosterone is the most important androgen, i.e., the major male sex hormone, in potency and quantity. It is remarkable to see how apparently relatively small differences between the two molecules can make such fundamental differences!</p>
<p>Cholecalciferol (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>) is a steroid hormone produced in the skin when exposed to ultraviolet light or obtained from dietary sources. The active metabolite of cholecalciferol, calcitriol plays an important role in maintaining blood calcium and phosphorus levels and mineralization of bone. Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism.</p>

<p>The transport of sterol lipids through vascular animal organisms is problematic because, despite the hydroxyl group of the <em>A</em> carbon ring of cholesterol (Figure <a href="molecular-families.html#fig:zoo-phytosterols">4.62</a>) that make sterol lipids somewhat polar, cholesterol is insoluble in water, very much like all lipids and in particular triglycerides. A specialized type of pseudo-organelles called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein">lipoproteins</a>
transports hydrophobic lipids through the body. This organelle is formed by a single layer of phospholipids assembled as a sphere creating a hydrophilic outer surface soluble in water, and a hydrophobic compartment inside in which cholesterol, cholesterol esters and triglycerides are stored. Inserted proteins called apolipoproteins provide structural, communication and enzymatic activities.</p>

<p>Depending on the size of the sphere, scientists have named these High Density Lipoproteins (HDL; 5-12 nm diameter), Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL; 18-25 nm diameter), Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL; 25-35 nm diameter), Very Low Density Lipoproteins (VLDL; 30-80 nm diameter), and chylomicrons (75-1200 nm diameter) <span class="citation">(Feingold and Grunfeld <a href="#ref-Feingold2018-mt">2018</a>)</span>. The HDL and LDL acronyms are rather well known and are common indicators reported in routine blood analyzes. Cholesterol in lipoproteins is often esterified with fatty acids to form <strong><em>sterol esters</em></strong>, making the molecules much less polar than free cholesterol.</p>
<p>Interestingly, cholesterol is not metabolized by humans as a source of energy, despite the fact that it stores quite a few electrons. Instead, cholesterol is a precursor of hormones, vitamin D, and its metabolites (e.g., bile acids) serve as surfactant in the digestive system to help digestion and assimilation of nutrients and essential molecules (e.g., amino-acids, monosaccharides, essential fatty acids).</p>

<strong>In summary:</strong>

<ul>
<li>
Almost all sterol and steroid lipids have four fused rings and a planar geometry, which gives them rigidity and strength. These properties are essential for their functions in cell membranes
</li>
<li>
They are all derived from the triterpene squalene
</li>
<li>
Zoo- and phytosterols play an essential role in the membrane nanodomains by rendering the membrane in a <strong>liquid-ordered</strong> phase, i.e., more gel-like and more rigid
</li>
<li>
Sterols tend not to serve as a source of energy in animals, but rather are degraded into metabolites that serve as surfactant in the digestive system to help digestion and assimilation of nutrients and essential molecules (e.g., amino-acids, monosaccharides, essential fatty acids)
</li>
<li>
Animal sterols (with triglycerides) being hydrophobic are carried in the blood in specialized single phospholipid layered vesicles called lipoproteins, the most known of which are HDL and LDL, usually in the form of sterol esters

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.5.12</span> Summary about the isoprene-based lipids</h3>
<p>Broadly, isoprene-based lipids are all based on isoprene units, which have the capacity to stay as linear chains, or form saturated and unsaturated carbon rings. The cyclization is complete with sterol lipids where mostly four fused rings and a planar geometry are at the basis of the structural strength of many zoo- and phytosterols when inserted in the acyl-based bilayer of membranes. Sterol metabolites such as steroid hormones play a major role in the development of animals. Isoprenoids such as prenol lipids play important role in energy capturing and electron transfer, as well as communication molecules, including vitamins and hormones.</p>
<p>This concludes the part on isoprene-based lipids. The next part briefly presents other lipids or biological importance we thought would fit better in their own part.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.5.13.1</span> Waxes as fatty acid esters</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no satisfactory definition of the word “wax” in chemical terms. It is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word “weax” for beeswax, so a practical definition of a wax may therefore be “a substance similar in composition and physical properties to beeswax”. Biochemists often link waxes with the thin layer of fatty constituents that cover the leaves of plants or provide a surface coating for insects or the skin of animals for which primary requirements are spreadability and chemical and metabolic stability. Such surface waxes are produced by specialized cells or glands, and all tend to contain wax esters as major and perhaps defining components, i.e. esters of long-chain fatty alcohols with long-chain fatty acids. <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most waxes are formed by two (fatty acid + fatty alcohol) or three moieties (fatty acid + fatty alkane-di-ol + fatty acid), in which case they are referred to as diester waxes. Waxes form the cuticle of plant leaves, but are also secreted by specialized glands in animals, in which case they tend to be associated with triacylglycerols and/or sterol esters. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uropygial_gland">uropygial gland</a> of birds produces waxes gives feathers their water tightness. Spermaceti or the substance present in sperm whale and skulls of other dolphin and whales, is made by 75% of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetyl_palmitate">cetyl palmitate</a> and 25% of triacylglycerols. The other animal wax of commercial value is wool wax of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanolin">lanolin</a> having waterproofing properties that aids sheep in shedding water from their coats. Lanolin contains up to 50% wax esters and 33% sterol (lanosterol) esters <span class="citation">(Christie, <a href="#ref-Christie_undated-hb">n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.5.13.2</span> Polyketides</h4>
<p>Polyketides are a large group of secondary metabolites which either contain alternating carbonyl and methylene groups (-CO-CH2-) <span class="citation">(Wikipedia contributors <a href="#ref-Wikipedia_contributors2020-vq">2020</a>)</span>. Many mycotoxins produced by fungi are polyketides or polyketide derivatives and many are commonly used as antimicrobial, antiparasitic, and anticancer agents. Important examples of these drugs include erythromycins, tetracylines, nystatins, avermectins, and antitumor epothilones <span class="citation">(Fahy et al. <a href="#ref-Fahy2005-gc">2005</a>)</span>.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">4.5.13.3</span> Natural cyclic fatty acid based lipids</h4>
<p>Branched-chain fatty acids are common in bacterial and archaeal membranes where their concentration often exceeds that of linear-chain fatty acids. The variations in the presence, nature, and number of branching groups in fatty acids lead to distinct physicochemical properties of the lipids that in turn result in biological membranes with unique structural and functional properties <span class="citation">(Poger and Mark <a href="#ref-Poger2015-vi">2015</a><a href="#ref-Poger2015-vi">b</a>)</span>.</p>

<strong>In summary:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lipids are fatty acids and their derivatives, and substances related biosynthetically or functionally to these compounds (Christie 1987)
</li>
<li>
Long aliphatic chains may store many electrons and lipids are thus the energy storage molecules
</li>
<li>
Fatty acyl chains open the possibility for amphiphatic properties with hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads, which allows the formation of very tight membranes and compartmentalization of the cell
</li>
<li>
Phosphates play an essential role in the structure of acyl-based membrane lipids and on the polar nature of the heads (along with moeities containing nitrogen)
</li>
<li>
The methylated and unsaturated aliphatic chains (e.g., isoprenoids), tend to form carbon rings, yielding lipids such as sterols which are small, yet strong enough to rigidify cell membranes
